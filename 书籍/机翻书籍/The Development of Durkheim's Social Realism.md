Edited by Quentin Skinner (General Editor) Lorraine Daston, Dorothy Ross and James Tully

编辑: Quentin Skinner (总编辑) Lorraine Daston，Dorothy Ross 和 James Tully

The books in this series will discuss the emergence of the intellectual traditions and of related new disciplines. The procedures, aims and vocabularies that were generated will be set in the context of the alternatives available within the contemporary frameworks of ideas and institutions. Through detailed studies of the evolution of such traditions, and their modi®cation by different audiences, it is hoped that a new picture will form of the development of ideas in their concrete contexts. By this means, arti®cial distinctions between the history of philosophy, of the various sciences, of society and politics, and of literature may be seen to dissolve.

本系列书籍将讨论知识传统和相关新学科的出现。所产生的程序、目标和词汇将在当代思想和体制框架内可供选择的范围内确定。通过详细研究这些传统的演变，以及不同受众对这些传统的修改，希望能够在其具体背景下形成思想发展的新图景。通过这种方式，哲学史、各种科学史、社会政治史和文学史之间的人为区别可以被看作是消除了。

The series is published with the support of the Exxon Foundation.

In sum, Montesquieu does not sufficiently appreciate how much, in Bacon’s words, the subtlety of things surpasses the subtlety of the human mind.

总之，用培根的话来说，孟德斯鸠没有充分认识到，事物的微妙之处在多大程度上超越了人类思维的微妙。

Quid Secondatus Politicae Scientiae Instituendae Contulerit (Montesquieu’s Contribution to the Rise of Social Science)

孟德斯鸠对社会科学兴起的贡献

We can see now the link which binds Rabelais and his age to the Middle Ages and Scholasticism. In spite of everything the book remains the object of a superstitious cult, albeit one of quite a different kind; the text remains something sacrosanct. But as against this, what a transformation, what a revolution has taken place! Something quite different is being sought for in the book: beyond the book, behind it, one can just see emerging, however timidly and uncertainly, the Thing.

我们现在可以看到拉伯雷和他的时代与中世纪和经院哲学的联系。尽管如此，这本书仍然是一个迷信崇拜的对象，尽管是一个完全不同的类型; 文本仍然是某种神圣的东西。但与此相反，发生了怎样的变化，怎样的革命！书中正在寻找一些完全不同的东西: 在书本之外，在它的背后，你可以看到正在出现的东西，无论多么胆怯和不确定。

## Note on texts and references 关于文本和参考文献的说明
 
In some cases, I have made use of existing translations of Durkheim's works, while in others I have relied on my own translations. To avoid confusion, my practice has been as follows. Where referring to Durkheim's works in the body of the text, I have consistently used the original title, together with the date on which that work first appeared — e.g., “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne'' (1887), De la division du travail social (1893), and so on. Where I have cited a specific passage, I have provided the date of the text used (whether the original or the translation), a letter (if necessary to indicate which text published during that year), and the page(s) cited. A citation from my translation of “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne,'' for example, appears as (1887b: 141—2), while a citation from W. D. Hall's translation of De la division du travail social appears as (1984: 291—341). Where I have cited Andre Lalande's recently discovered notes from Durkheim's philosophy lectures at the Lycee de Sens (1883—4), I have used the date 1884, followed by the page numbers of the original manuscript at the Bibliotheque de la Sorbonne (MS no. 2351).

在某些情况下，我利用现有的迪尔凯姆作品的翻译，而在另一些情况下，我依赖于我自己的翻译。为了避免混淆，我的做法如下。在文本正文中提到涂尔干的作品时，我一直使用原来的标题，以及该作品首次出现的日期ーー例如，《德国道德的积极科学》(1887年)、《社会工作的分工》(1893年)等。凡引用某段文字，本人已提供所用文字的日期(不论是原文或译文)、信件(如有需要，以显示该年发表的文字)及所引用的页数。例如，我翻译的《德意志道德的科学正面》中的一个引文出现在(1887b: 141ー2) ，而 W · D · 霍尔翻译的《社会劳动分工》中的一个引文出现在(1984:291ー341)。我引用了安德烈 · 拉兰德(Andre Lalande)最近从迪尔凯姆在森斯中学(Lycee de Sens)的哲学讲座中发现的笔记(1883-4) ，我使用的日期是1884年，其次是索邦大学图书馆(Bibiotheque de la Sorbonne)原稿的页码(MS No. 2351)。
 
## Introduction: sociology and its history 引言: 社会学及其历史
 
This book has two main goals. The irst is to explore the meaning and significance of the constellation of ideas in Durkheim’s work that is often characterized as his “social realism’’ — i.e., the view, epitomized in Les Regies de la methode sociologique (1895), that social phenomena should be studied comme des choses, as real, concrete things, subject to the laws of nature and discoverable by scientiic reason. The second, subsidiary goal is to exemplify a particular way of thinking and speaking about the history of sociological theory, one that might best be described as “historicist,” “nominalist,” and/or “pragmatist.” For me, the irst goal has always been the most important. But since so much of what I have to say about Durkheim presupposes some grasp of my views on sociology and its history, this introduction will begin with a brief explanation of the second.

这本书有两个主要目标。首先是探讨迪尔凯姆作品中思想星座的意义和意义，这些思想通常被描述为他的“社会现实主义”ーー即，社会学方法论(1895年)中概括的观点，即社会现象应该作为真实的、具体的事物来研究，服从于自然规律并由科学理性发现。第二个次要目标是用一种特殊的方式来思考和谈论社会学理论的历史，这种方式最好被描述为“历史决定论者”、“唯名论者”和/或“实用主义者”对我来说，第一个目标一直是最重要的。但是，由于我要说的关于涂尔干的大部分内容都是以我对社会学及其历史的理解为前提的，因此本文将以第二部分的简要解释开始。

In a famous essay published in 1984, Richard Rorty suggested that we think of the history of ideas as comprising different kinds of “conversations” that we imagine and reconstruct, sometimes between ourselves and classic writers of the past, and sometimes among the classic writers themselves. In “rational reconstructions,” for example, we imagine and then converse with an “ideally reasonable and educable Durkheim’’ — e.g., the Durkheim who speaks our language, who might be brought to describe himself as having overstated the “objectivity” of social facts, the “normality” of crime, or the “pathology” of the forced division of labor. Once our concepts and language are thus imposed on Durkheim, and he has been brought to accept such a new description of what he meant or did, he becomes one of us, our contemporary, a fellow-citizen, a colleague in our disciplinary matrix (1984: 51—2). The goal of such “rational reconstructions,” Rorty tells us, is reassurance or self-justification — i.e., our quite natural and reasonable desire to see the history of sociological theory as “a long conversational interchange” in a fairly stable idiom, and thus to assure ourselves that “there has been rational progress in the course of recorded history — that we differ from our ancestors on grounds which our ancestors could be led to accept” (1984: 51). I take this to be the kind of reconstruction in which most sociologists are engaged when they write or speak about Marx, Durkheim, and/or Weber.

在1984年发表的一篇著名文章中，理查德 · 罗蒂(Richard Rorty)提出，我们认为思想史是由我们想象和重建的不同类型的“对话”组成的，有时是我们自己和过去的经典作家之间的对话，有时是经典作家之间的对话。例如，在“理性重建”中，我们想象然后与一个“理想的、合理的、可教育的涂尔干”交谈，例如，说我们语言的涂尔干，他可能会被描述为夸大了社会事实的“客观性”，犯罪的“正常性”，或者强制分工的“病态性”。一旦我们的概念和语言被强加到涂尔干身上，并且他被迫接受对他的意思和行为的新的描述，他就成为我们的一员，我们的同代人，我们的同胞，我们学科矩阵中的同事(1984:51ー2)。罗蒂告诉我们，这种“理性重建”的目标是让我们放心或自我辩护ーー也就是说，我们相当自然和合理的愿望，就是把社会学理论的历史看作是一个相当稳定的成语中的“长时间的对话交流”，从而让我们自己确信“在有记载的历史进程中已经有了理性的进展ーー我们与我们的祖先不同的理由是我们的祖先可以接受的”(1984:51)。我认为这是大多数社会学家在撰写或谈论马克思、涂尔干和/或韦伯时所从事的那种重建。

As an historian, of course, I sometimes find such reconstructions hopelessly anachronistic (Jones 1977: 282—9). More recently, however, I’ve come to agree with Rorty that this kind of self-conscious anachronism has a kind ofjustihcation. When theorists say (anachro-nistically) that Durkheim anticipated or adumbrated ideas of which he cannot have been aware, they (presumably) mean that, in an imagined conversation with present-day theorists about whether or not he should have held certain other views, Durkheim would have been driven back on a premise that he never formulated, dealing with a topic he never considered — a premise that might have to be suggested to him by a friendly rational reconstructor (Rorty 1984: 53). For all their anachronism, therefore, rational reconstructions at least serve to expand the circle of what Rorty has called “edifying conversational partners,’’ embracing the mighty dead as well as those still living; and as long as sociologists are aware that Durkheim is thus being described as holding beliefs he never held, and performing actions he never perfor med, such imaginary conversations seem unobjectionable, and might be extremely useful.

当然，作为一个历史学家，我有时会发现这样的重建完全是不合时宜的(琼斯1977:282ー9)。然而最近，我开始同意罗蒂的观点，这种自我意识的时代错误有一种合理性。当理论家们(过时地)说涂尔干预测或预示了他不可能意识到的观点时，他们(大概)的意思是，在与当今理论家想象的关于他是否应该持有某些其他观点的对话中，涂尔干会在一个他从未阐述过的前提下被驱回，处理一个他从未考虑过的主题ーー一个可能必须由一个友好的理性重建者向他提出的前提(罗蒂1984:53)。因此，尽管他们的时代错误，理性的重建至少有助于扩大罗蒂所说的“有益的对话伙伴”的圈子，拥抱强大的死者和仍然活着的人; 只要社会学家意识到涂尔干因此被描述为持有他从未持有过的信念，并执行他从未执行过的行动，这种想象的对话似乎不会引起反感，而且可能是非常有用的。

But there is also a second, more genuinely “historical” type of reconstruction. Here we are less interested in the Durkheim who might be led to converse with us than with imagined conversations between Durkheim and his contemporaries, in their own language rather than ours — in short, to embrace the historicist commitment to understand the past, in so far as it is possible, “in its own terms.’’ As Rorty has observed, the value of these reconstructions lies, not in reassurance or self-justification, but in self-knowledge or self-awareness — i.e., “in the fact that, instead of supplying us with our usual and carefully contrived pleasures of recognition, [the classic writers] enable us to stand back from our own beliefs and the concepts we use to express them, perhaps forcing us to reconsider, to recast or even . . . to abandon some of our current beliefs in the light of these wider perspectives” (Skinner 1984: 202, 197—8; Jones and Kibbee 1993: 156). To read these more historical reconstructions, to imagine these conversations that take place in an entirely different idiom, is quite literally to encounter other vocabularies — many of them impressive enough to induce doubt and reflection about our own.

但是，还有第二种更加真正的“历史性”重建方式。在这里，我们对迪尔凯姆不那么感兴趣，他可能会被引导与我们交谈，而是想象着迪尔凯姆与同时代人之间用他们自己的语言(而不是我们的语言)进行的对话——简而言之，接受历史决定论者的承诺，即尽可能“以自己的方式”理解过去正如罗蒂所观察到的，这些重建的价值不在于安慰或自我辩护，而在于自我认识或自我意识ーー也就是说，“事实上，(经典作家)不是为我们提供我们通常精心设计的认知的乐趣，而是使我们能够从我们自己的信念和我们用来表达它们的概念中站起来，也许迫使我们重新考虑，重塑甚至... ... 放弃我们当前的一些信念，以这些更广泛的视角”(Skinner 1984:202,197ー8; Jones and Kibbee 1993:156)。阅读这些历史重现，想象这些对话发生在一个完全不同的习语中，实际上是遇到了其他词汇ーー其中许多令人印象深刻，足以引起对我们自己词汇的怀疑和反思。

Among the most distinguished examples of such genuinely historical reconstructions are the works of Quentin Skinner, who has followed the lead of philosophers like J. L. Austin (1975) and R. G. Collingwood (1939) by encouraging us to ask what the classic writer “was doing” in saying what he said, and reconstructing the questions to which the classic text was a putative answer. Consider the effort of Descartes, both in the Discourse and in the Meditations, to vindicate the idea of certain, indubitable knowledge. Why, Skinner asks, was this an issue for him at all? Since Descartes was an epistemologist, and since certainty is one of the central problems of epistemology, more traditional historians of ideas have scarcely acknowledged the question, concentrating instead on what Descartes actually said about how we can achieve such certainty. But this, Skinner objects, is an instance of “insufficient puzzlement” — i.e., by leaving us without any sense of the specific question to which Descartes may have intended his doctrine of certainty as a solution, this traditional approach also leaves us without any understanding of what he may have been doing in presenting his doctrine in the precise form in which he chose to present it (1988: 282—3). In fact, it now seems clear that Descartes was responding to the Pyrrhonian skepticism of writers like Montaigne, an action that helps to explain both the character of his anti-skeptical arguments and the strategies he used to advance them. Yet until scholars like Richard Popkin (1969) and E. M. Curley (1978) became “sufficiently puzzled” about the problem to which Descartes was responding, both the arguments and the strategies remained opaque because the question itself had never been raised.

这种真正的历史重建最杰出的例子之一是昆汀 · 斯金纳的作品，他追随像奥斯汀(1975)和罗宾·乔治·科林伍德(1939)这样的哲学家的领导，鼓励我们问经典作家在说他所说的话时“在做什么”，并重建经典文本可以作为假定答案的问题。考虑笛卡尔在《论语》和《沉思录》中为证明某些确定无疑的知识的观点所做的努力。斯金纳问道，为什么这对他来说是个问题呢？由于笛卡尔是一位认识论者，而确定性又是认识论的核心问题之一，所以更多的传统思想史家几乎不承认这个问题，而是关注笛卡尔关于我们如何实现这种确定性的实际说法。但是，斯金纳反对说，这是一个“不充分的困惑”的例子ーー也就是说，这种传统的方法让我们对笛卡尔可能打算用确定性学说作为解决方案的具体问题没有任何感觉，也让我们对他可能在以他选择的精确形式提出他的学说时所做的事情没有任何理解(1988:282ー3)。事实上，现在看来很清楚，笛卡尔是在回应像蒙田这样的作家的皮罗诺式怀疑论，这一行动有助于解释他的反怀疑论的特点和他用来推进这些论点的策略。然而，直到像理查德 · 波普金(1969)和 E · M · 柯利(1978)这样的学者对笛卡尔所回应的问题变得“足够困惑”之前，论点和策略都是不透明的，因为这个问题本身从未被提出过。

Similarly, there has been no lack of discussion of Durkheim's social realism in the secondary literature. Since Durkheim was a sociologist, and since a commitment to the “reality” of social phenomena seems almost an unquestioned article of faith among sociologists, there has been little discussion of why this was a commitment for Durkheim in the first place. The conversation has focused instead on the primarily methodological issue of how social facts might be studied comme des choses. Though hardly silent on Durkheim's social realism, therefore, sociologists have in this sense been “insufficiently puzzled” about the question to which social realism was presumably an answer — the problem for which it was offered as a solution. In short, we have lacked an account of what the early Durkheim was doing in developing his realist social theory between the early 1880s and the publication of Le Suicide in 1897.

同样，在中学文学中也不乏对涂尔干社会现实主义的探讨。由于涂尔干是一位社会学家，并且由于对社会现象的“现实”的承诺似乎在社会学家中几乎是一个不容置疑的信仰条款，所以很少有人讨论为什么这是涂尔干的首要承诺。相反，对话集中在主要的方法论问题上，即如何将社会事实作为决定性因素加以研究。因此，尽管对涂尔干的社会现实主义几乎没有保持沉默，但从这个意义上来说，社会学家对于社会现实主义可能是一个答案的问题ーー这个问题被提供作为一个解决方案的问题ーー还是“不够困惑”。简而言之，我们缺乏对早期涂尔干在19世纪80年代早期到1897年出版《自杀》之间发展他的现实主义社会理论所做工作的描述。

What was Durkheim doing? What was the question for which social realism was Durkheim’s answer? Briefly, I will suggest that the question was not unlike that to which Plato replied in the early Socratic dialogues. There Socrates interrogates various Athenians concerning the nature of some virtue, repeatedly entrapping them in contradictions and inconsistencies. The reasonable first impression here is that Plato’s intention was to contrast the rigor and precision of Socrates’ arguments with the sloppiness and stupidity of those of the Athenians. But so frequently does this pattern recur (and so determinedly confused are some of Socrates’ interlocutors) that the way to an alternative interpretation seems open. One such alternative argument is that Plato was pointing to a state of incoherence in the moral language of Athenian culture — i.e., that the conceptual apparatus which the Athenians had inherited from the societies represented in the Homeric epics (societies based primarily on kinship) was simply inadequate in the quite different context of the Greek polis. It was this linguistic incoherence and its resulting tensions, so the argument goes, which were explored artistically in the tragedies of Sophocles; and at least one purpose of the early Platonic dialogues would thus have been to purge the Greek language of these Homeric survivals, and to replace them with Plato’s own, more coherent and well-ordered normative vocabulary (MacIntyre 1981: 131—45).

涂尔干在干什么？迪尔凯姆对哪一种社会现实主义的回答是什么？简而言之，我认为这个问题与柏拉图在早期苏格拉底对话中回答的问题没有什么不同。在那里，苏格拉底审问各种雅典人关于某种美德的本质，反复地将他们陷入矛盾和不一致之中。这里合理的第一印象是，柏拉图的意图是将苏格拉底论点的严谨和精确与雅典人的草率和愚蠢进行对比。但是这种模式如此频繁地重复出现(苏格拉底的一些对话者也是如此坚决地感到困惑) ，以至于另一种解释的道路似乎是开放的。另一种观点认为，柏拉图指出了雅典文化中道德语言的不连贯性ーー即雅典人从荷马史诗(主要基于亲属关系的社会)中所继承的概念机制，在希腊城邦完全不同的背景下是不够的。正是这种语言上的不连贯性及其导致的紧张关系，所以这个论点继续下去，在 Sophocles 的悲剧中被艺术地探索，因此早期柏拉图对话的至少一个目的就是清除希腊语中的这些荷马遗存，并用柏拉图自己的更连贯、更有序的规范性词汇取而代之(麦金太尔1981:131ー45)。

In the argument that follows, I will suggest that something similar was at stake in Durkheim’s effort to contrive the language of social realism. It is impossible to read the lectures that posthumously became L'Education morale (1925) and L'Evolution pedagogique en France (1938), for example, without becoming aware of Durkheim’s searing contempt for the vocabulary of Cartesian metaphysics. This is not to say that Durkheim considered himself anything but a rationalist; on the contrary, he regarded Cartesianism as “deeply rooted in our national thinking,’’ and “one of the characteristic traits of the French mind’’ (1961: 253). But Durkheim also considered the conceptual apparatus of Cartesian rationalism — in which complexity was consistently reduced to simplicity, the concrete to the abstract, observation and experience to logic and reasoning, things to ideas — as deeply problematic, admirably suited, as he said, to the mechanical, mathematical certainties of the 17th century, but completely inadequate when applied to the social and ethical demands of advanced industrial societies. In particular, Durkheim regarded modern societies as enormously complex wholes which, subjected to the principles of an “oversimplihed rationalism,” would be reduced to their constituent elements, and thus deprived of any objective moral foundation whatsoever. In an age of individualism, egoism, and anomie, it was essential that the institutions of the Third Republic become the primary focus of a citizen’s duties and obligations; and no “mental construct,’’ no Cartesian idee claire et simple, could ever become the object of such unqualihed allegiance. “It would be absurd,’’ Durkheim insisted, “to sacrihce the real, concrete, and living being that we are to a purely verbal artifact. We can only dedicate ourselves to society if we see in it a moral power more elevated than ourselves’’ (1961: 257).

在接下来的论证中，我将指出，在涂尔干设计社会现实主义语言的努力中，类似的东西正处于危险之中。举例来说，在读到迪尔凯姆死后成为“教育士气”(1925年)和“法国进化教育学”(1938年)的讲座时，我们不可能不意识到迪尔凯姆对笛卡尔形而上学词汇的强烈蔑视。这并不是说迪尔凯姆认为自己只是一个理性主义者; 相反，他认为笛卡尔主义“深深植根于我们的民族思想”，并且是“法国思想的特征之一”(1961:253)。但迪尔凯姆也认为笛卡尔理性主义的概念机制(其中复杂性一直被简化为简单，具体化为抽象，观察和经验成为逻辑和推理，事物成为思想)存在深刻的问题，正如他所说，它非常适合17世纪的机械和数学确定性，但在应用于先进工业社会的社会和伦理需求时，它是完全不够的。特别是，迪尔凯姆认为现代社会是一个极其复杂的整体，受制于“过于简单的理性主义”的原则，会被简化为它们的组成要素，从而剥夺了任何客观的道德基础。在一个个人主义、利己主义和混乱的时代，第三共和国的制度必须成为公民义务和责任的主要焦点; 任何“精神构造”，任何笛卡尔式的思想，克莱尔等简单，都不可能成为这种毫无保留的忠诚的对象。“这是荒谬的,”涂尔干坚持认为，“牺牲真实的，具体的，生活的存在，我们是一个纯粹的口头艺术品。只有当我们看到一种比我们自己更高尚的道德力量时，我们才能将自己奉献给社会”(1961:257)。

For Durkheim, this was why social phenomena should be understood comme des choses, as real, concrete things, subject to the laws of nature, resistant to human will, and discoverable by scientihc reason through their properties of externality and constraint. Sociologists, of course, describe this as a methodological injunction, one that has become a standard part of most introductory sociology textbooks. The point of my argument, however, will be that Durkheim’s interests and purposes were at least as much moral and political — i.e., to construct a normative vocabulary, a new way of speaking about duties, obligations, and ideals that would take the place of the Cartesian idiom. Like Plato, therefore, Durkheim was pointing to a general state of crisis in the moral language of his culture, and attempting to replace it with metaphors more adequate to the needs of his time.

对涂尔干来说，这就是为什么社会现象应该被理解为事物，作为真实的、具体的事物，服从自然法则，抵制人类意志，并通过其外部性和约束性的属性被科学理性发现。当然，社会学家将其描述为一种方法论上的禁令，它已经成为大多数社会学入门教科书的标准部分。然而，我的观点是，涂尔干的兴趣和目的至少是道德和政治上的ーー也就是说，建立一个规范的词汇，一种新的方式来谈论责任、义务和理想，这将取代笛卡尔的成语。因此，像柏拉图一样，涂尔干指出了他的文化中道德语言的普遍危机状态，并试图用更适合他的时代需要的隐喻来代替它。

If we think of Durkheim in this way — i.e., as someone cobbling together a language rather than discovering something about Nature — his social realism appears less as a coherent doctrine or theory than as an assortment of rhetorical strategies. On the one hand, it described society as not only “similar to’’ nature, but as itself a real, natural thing, a part of nature, and subject to its laws. On the other hand, this same vocabulary insisted that society is a particular, distinctive part of nature, a reality sui generis, irreducible to the laws discovered by psychologists or biologists. There was always a precarious tension, if not conflict, between these two metaphors — the former vulnerable to the criticism that it explained social phenomena by referring to non-social (e.g., psychological and biological) causes, and the latter to the charge that sociology is not a “science” at all. Durkheim’s description of society as an external, regulative force, epitomized in his treatment of anomic suicide, thus had to be balanced with his depiction of society as the source of positive, collective ideals, exemplified in his treatment of aboriginal religion. If Durkheim often spoke like an empiricist when attacking Descartes in L'Education morale, he could also sound like a rationalist when criticizing Mill in Les Regles (indeed, by 1897, he would embrace the “rationalist empiricism” of Hippolyte Taine). Finally, if this ingenious manipulation of these multiple rhetorical strategies is one measure of the extent of Durkheim’s achievement, it has also contributed to the linguistic incoherence of subsequent sociological debate — including disagreement over the meaning and signihcance of Durkheim’s works.

如果我们这样看待涂尔干ーー也就是说，他是一个拼凑语言的人，而不是发现了有关自然的东西ーー他的社会现实主义似乎不是一个连贯的学说或理论，而是一种修辞策略的分类。一方面，它不仅将社会描述为“类似”自然，而且将社会本身描述为一个真实的、自然的事物，一个自然的一部分，并服从于它的规律。另一方面，同样的词汇坚持认为，社会是一个特殊的，独特的自然部分，一个独特的现实，不可还原的法律发现的心理学家或生物学家。这两个隐喻之间总是存在着一种不稳定的紧张关系，如果不是冲突的话。前者容易受到批评，认为它通过提及非社会(如心理和生物)原因来解释社会现象，而后者则容易受到社会学根本不是一门“科学”的指责。涂尔干将社会描述为一种外部的、规范性的力量，集中体现在他对失范性自杀的处理上，因此必须与他将社会描述为积极的、集体理想的源泉保持平衡，例如他对原住民宗教的处理。如果迪尔凯姆在批评笛卡尔在《教育》中的道德观时经常像经验主义者那样说话，那么他在批评 Les Regles 的密尔时也可以像理性主义者那样说话(事实上，到了1897年，他会接受希波吕忒 · 泰恩的“理性主义经验主义”)。最后，如果这种巧妙地运用这些多重修辞策略是迪尔凯姆成就的一个衡量标准的话，那么它也促成了随后社会学辩论的语言不连贯性ーー包括对迪尔凯姆作品的意义和重要性的分歧。

This essay is an effort to reconstruct Durkheim’s shaping of this vocabulary. In chapter 1, for example, I describe the social, political, and religious context of the Third Republic, with special emphasis on the years 1879—85, during which the republican project of laicizing French education was effected. In one sense, this “reform that contained all other reforms’’ became the vehicle whereby sociology was institutionalized in French primary and secondary education; but in a larger sense, this hnal collapse of the Church as a source of authority created the moral vacuum that social realism was supposed to ®ll. In this sense, I shall argue, sociology was less an end in itself than a means to the achievement of moral and political goals. In chapter 2, I discuss Durkheim’s views on the history and theory of moral education, particularly as reflected in the lectures posthumously published as L'Evolution pedagogique en France (1938) and L'Education morale (1925). These lectures represent a relatively late stage in the development of Durkheim’s thought, and they are introduced early in my book for two reasons. First, they provide us with Durkheim’s most self-conscious reflections on the policies of educational reform described in the chapter that immediately precedes them. Second, if — as I have suggested — Durkheim’s social realism constitutes a vocabulary constructed to serve quite concrete interests and purposes, these lectures afford the clearest sense of what these interests and purposes were. In effect, they provide the context within which the development of that vocabulary — the subject of the subsequent chapters — makes the most sense. By my describing these commitments up front, in considerable detail, the reader will be better prepared to understand the significance of arguments made in Durkheim's earlier works.

本文试图重建涂尔干对这一词汇的塑造。例如，在第一章中，我描述了第三共和国的社会、政治和宗教背景，特别强调了1879-85年，在此期间，共和国实施了将法国教育合法化的计划。从某种意义上说，这种“包含所有其他改革的改革”成为了社会学在法国中小学教育中制度化的载体; 但从更广泛的意义上说，教会作为权威来源的这种内在崩溃创造了社会现实主义应该创造的道德真空。在这个意义上，我认为，社会学本身与其说是一个目的，不如说是一种实现道德和政治目标的手段。在第二章中，我讨论了涂尔干关于道德教育的历史和理论的观点，特别是在他死后发表的《法国进化教育学》(1938年)和《教育士气》(1925年)讲座中反映出来的观点。这些讲座代表了迪尔凯姆思想发展的一个相对较晚的阶段，它们在我的书中很早就被介绍了，原因有二。首先，它们为我们提供了涂尔干在前一章中所描述的教育改革政策的最自觉的反思。其次，如果正如我所说的，迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义构成了一个服务于相当具体的利益和目的的词汇表，那么这些讲座提供了这些利益和目的是什么的最清晰的感觉。实际上，它们提供了词汇发展(后续章节的主题)最有意义的语境。通过我在前面相当详细地描述这些承诺，读者将更好地理解涂尔干早期作品中论点的意义。

In chapter 3, I return to a more conventional, chronological approach to the development of Durkheim's thought, discussing Andre Lalande's recently discovered lecture notes from Durkheim's philosophy course taught at the Lycee de Sens in 1883-4. These notes make it clear that, as late as 1884, Durkheim had not yet embraced anything resembling his later social realism. On the contrary, his views on morality and society seem to approximate the neo-critical individualism of Charles Renouvier's Science de la morale (1869). The Sens lectures also provide a context within which to discuss the influence of Durkheim's teachers at the Ecole Normale Superieure - the historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges (1830-89) and the philosopher Emile Boutroux (1845-1921) - as well as Charles Renouvier (1815-1903). The same lectures set the stage for chapter 4, where I discuss Durkheim's important visit to Berlin, Marburg, and Leipzig in 1885 and 1886, which brought him into contact with German political economy, jurisprudence, and most importantly, the experimental psychology and ethics of Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920). By the time Durkheim returned, he seemed to have lost much of his interest in Renouvier's ethics (although not in Renouvier), and had begun to construct the vocabulary that would inform L'Evolution pedagogique en France and L'Education morale. These views are already evident in Durkheim's two doctoral theses - i.e., the Latin thesis on Montesquieu (1892) and De la division du travail social (1893), as well as Les Regles de la methode sociologique (1895). It was the latter work that embroiled Durkheim in the famous controversy with Jean-Gabriel Tarde (1843-1904), his most formidable critic; and it was in the context of his response to Tarde and the early stages of his involvement in L'Affaire Dreyfus that Durkheim revisited the works of Rousseau, offering a lecture course on Le Contrat social that was clearly instrumental in developing the powerful social realism of Le Suicide (1897) and later works. The discussion of the Latin thesis, the quarrel with Tarde, and the lectures on Rousseau thus complete chapter 5 - Durkheim's fragmentary notes on Emile completing the circle, recalling Durkheim's lectures on the history and theory of moral education and their role within the laicizing reforms of the Third Republic.

在第三章，我回到一个更加传统的，按时间顺序的方法来发展涂尔干的思想，讨论安德烈拉兰德最近发现的讲义笔记从涂尔干的哲学课程教在中学德森在1883-4。这些笔记清楚地表明，直到1884年，涂尔干还没有接受任何类似他后来的社会现实主义的东西。相反，他关于道德和社会的观点似乎接近于查尔斯 · 雷诺维尔(Charles Renouvier)的《道德科学》(Science de la Mordience，1869)中的新批判个人主义。森斯的讲座还提供了一个背景，在这个背景下，我们可以讨论涂尔干的高等师范学校老师——历史学家努马-丹尼斯·甫斯特尔·德·库朗日(1830-89)和哲学家埃米尔•布特鲁克斯(1845-1921)——以及查尔斯•雷诺维耶(1815-1903)的影响。同样的演讲为第四章奠定了基础，在那里我讨论了涂尔干在1885年和1886年对柏林、马堡和莱比锡的重要访问，这使他接触到德国的政治经济学、法理学，最重要的是，威廉 · 冯特(1832-1920)的实验心理学和伦理学。当涂尔干回来的时候，他似乎已经对雷诺维耶的伦理学失去了很多兴趣(尽管不是在雷诺维耶) ，并且已经开始构建词汇，这些词汇可以告诉法国的进化教育学和教育士气。这些观点在迪尔凯姆的两篇博士论文中已经很明显了，即《关于孟德斯鸠的拉丁文论文》(1892年)和《社会工作分工》(1893年) ，以及《社会学方法规则》(1895年)。正是后一部作品使涂尔干卷入了与让-加布里埃尔 · 塔德(Jean-Gabriel Tarde，1843-1904)的著名争论，塔德是涂尔干最令人敬畏的批评家; 正是在他对塔德的回应以及他参与《德雷福斯事件》早期阶段的背景下，涂尔干重新审视了卢梭的作品，提供了一个关于《社会契约论》的讲座课程，这显然有助于发展《自杀论》(Le Suice，1897)及其后期作品中强大的社会现实主义。关于拉丁文命题的讨论，与塔尔德的争论，以及关于卢梭的演讲，从而完成了第五章——涂尔干关于埃米尔完成这个循环的零碎笔记，回顾了涂尔干关于道德教育的历史和理论，以及它们在第三共和国的合法化改革中的作用的演讲。

As this brief summary suggests, I've avoided (except where particularly pertinent) any detailed discussion of the events of Durkheim’s life, as well as thematic summaries of his most familiar works (of which many excellent examples already exist in the secondary literature). Instead, I’ve focused on texts that are perhaps less familiar to sociologists (e.g., the Sens lectures, book reviews, the “German” essays of 1887, the Latin thesis, the lectures on Le Contrat social and Emile, etc.) and those intellectual influences (e.g., Fustel, Boutroux, Renouvier, Wundt, Montesquieu, Tarde, Rousseau, etc.) that encourage us to see Durkheim’s project as the metaphorical construction of a new moral vocabulary for the Third Republic. In short, I’ve tried to reconstruct an imagined conversation between Durkheim, his contemporaries, and his antecedents. In Skinner’s formulation, it is the context of the things that he himself might, at least in principle, have accepted as a description of what he was doing. (It is also, I should add, what he rather clearly did say he was doing in L'Evolution pedagogique en France and L'Education morale.} Most importantly, because this is a self-consciously “historical” - by contrast with “rational” — reconstruction, the Durkheim who emerges from this re-description is not necessarily “one of us,’’ not a “fellow citizen’’ or “participant in the same disciplinary matrix.’’ On the contrary, he is concerned with the quite specific and contingent problems of the Third Republic, and social realism is described as an answer to his questions, not to ours. Why, then, one might ask, should we continue to read Durkheim’s works? And why in particular should we re-describe them in this historicist manner? How is the promise of “self-knowledge” or “self-awareness” to be realized in more concrete terms? Recalling that to read Durkheim in this way is to encounter vocabularies other than one’s own, I suggest in my conclusion that intellectual history might afford a catalyst for what Rorty has called an “ironist” perspective on our current intellectual commitments, one that would encourage some salutary doubt about our “final vocabularies.” I can think of few things that would be more useful.

正如这个简短的总结所表明的，我避免了(除非特别相关)对迪尔凯姆生平事件的任何详细讨论，以及对他最熟悉的作品的主题总结(其中许多优秀的例子已经存在于次要文献中)。相反，我关注的是社会学家可能不太熟悉的文本(例如，森斯的讲座、书评、1887年的“德国”文章、拉丁文论文、《社会契约论》和《埃米尔》等)和那些鼓励我们把迪尔凯姆的项目视为第三共和国新道德词汇的隐喻性建构的知识影响(例如，福斯特尔、布特鲁克斯、雷诺维耶、冯特、孟德斯鸠、 Tarde、卢梭等)。简而言之，我试图重建迪尔凯姆，他的同时代人，和他的前辈们之间想象出来的对话。在斯金纳的表述中，这是他自己可能，至少在原则上，已经接受的事情的背景，作为他正在做的事情的描述。(我应该补充一点，这也是他在《法国进化教育学》和《教育士气》中明确提到的内容。)最重要的是，因为这是一种自觉的“历史”——与“理性”——重建相反，从这种重新描述中出现的迪尔凯姆不一定是“我们中的一员”，不一定是“同胞”或“同一学科矩阵的参与者”相反，他关心的是第三共和国相当具体和偶然的问题，社会现实主义被描述为对他的问题的答案，而不是对我们的问题的答案。那么，有人可能会问，为什么我们还要继续读涂尔干的作品呢？我们为什么要用这种历史决定论的方式来重新描述它们呢？如何更具体地实现“自知”或“自觉”的承诺？回想起以这种方式阅读涂尔干，就意味着遇到了不属于自己的词汇，我在结论中提出，思想史可能为罗蒂所称的对我们当前知识承诺的“讽刺”视角提供了一种催化剂，这种视角可能会鼓励对我们的“最终词汇”产生一些有益的怀疑我想不出更有用的东西了。

CHAPTER I

第一章
 
## The reform that contained all other reforms 包含所有其他改革的改革
 
“When a people has achieved a state of equilibrium and maturity,” Durkheim observed in his seventh lecture on moral education, “when the various social functions, at least temporarily, are articulated in an ordered fashion, when the collective sentiments in their essentials are incontestable for the great majority of people, then the preference for rule and order is naturally preponderant.” It was this moral situation, for example, that had characterized Rome under Augustus, and France under Louis XIV By contrast, “in times of flux and change, the spirit of discipline cannot preserve its moral vigor since the prevailing system of rules is shaken, at least in some of its parts. At such times, it is inevitable that we feel less keenly the authority of a discipline that is, in fact, attenuated” (1961: 100—1).

“当一个民族达到了一种平衡和成熟的状态,”涂尔干在他关于道德教育的第七次演讲中指出，“当各种社会功能，至少是暂时的，以一种有序的方式表达出来，当它们本质上的集体情感对于绝大多数人来说是无可争议的时候，那么对统治和秩序的偏好就自然而然地占了上风。”例如，正是这种道德状况，塑造了奥古斯都统治下的罗马和路易十四统治下的法国。相比之下，“在动荡和变化的时代，纪律的精神无法保持其道德活力，因为现行的规则体系受到了动摇，至少在某些方面是如此。在这样的时刻，我们不可避免地会对一门实际上已经衰减的学科的权威感到不那么强烈”(1961:100ー1)。

Durkheim had no illusions about the type of society or historical period in which he was living: “Now,” he emphasized, “we are going through precisely one of these critical phases. Indeed, history records no crisis as serious as that in which European societies have been involved for more than a century. Collective discipline in its traditional form has lost its authority, as the divergent tendencies troubling the public conscience and the resulting general anxiety demonstrate. Consequently, the spirit of discipline itself has lost its ascendancy” (1961: 101). As we shall see, this was the problem for which Durkheim's solution was social realism. But in order to understand this solution — and why it seemed such a plausible solution to Durkheim — we must first have some grasp of the problem itself.

涂尔干对他所生活的社会或历史时期的类型没有任何幻想: “现在,”他强调，“我们正在经历这些关键阶段中的一个。事实上，历史上没有任何危机像欧洲社会一个多世纪以来所经历的那样严重。传统形式的集体纪律已经失去了权威，公众良心的不同倾向和由此产生的普遍焦虑表明了这一点。因此，纪律的精神本身已经失去了它的优势”(1961:101)。正如我们将要看到的，这就是迪尔凯姆的解决办法是社会现实主义的问题。但是，为了理解这个解决方案ーー以及为什么它对涂尔干来说似乎是一个看似合理的解决方案ーー我们必须首先对问题本身有一些把握。

THE COALITIOn OF THE THIRD ESTATE

第三产业联盟

In 1872 the population of France was 36,103,000. By 1886, it had risen to 38,517,000, an annual increase of only 89,700. The birth rate had begun a steady fall, while the death rate would scarcely vary until the end of the century. By the early 1890s there would be more deaths than births, an event so unprecedented that alarmed onlookers dubbed it the “stagnation.” The traditional, fertile, Catholic family had confronted its modern, Malthusian counterpart. “Parents,” Mayeur and Reberioux have observed, “calculated and looked ahead, concerned to rise socially and to provide a good future for their children. This ‘bourgeois’ conception of the family spread progressively to all layers of society, reflecting the aspirations of individualism and egalitarianism” — a movement which particularly affected the lower middle class (1984: 43).

1872年，法国人口为36,103,000。到1886年，这个数字已经上升到38,517,000，年增长率仅为89,700。出生率开始稳步下降，而死亡率在本世纪末之前几乎没有变化。到19世纪90年代早期，死亡人数将超过出生人数，这一史无前例的事件让旁观者惊恐不已，称之为“停滞”这个传统的，富饶的，天主教家庭面对着现代的，马尔萨斯主义的对手。Mayeur 和 Reberioux 观察到，“父母有计划地展望未来，关心社会地位的提高，并为他们的孩子提供一个美好的未来。这种“资产阶级”的家庭观念逐渐蔓延到社会的各个层面，反映了个人主义和平均主义的愿望”ーー这一运动尤其影响到中下层阶级(1984:43)。

The ideological response to this stagnation was mixed. Local authorities and the French Parliament remained utterly indifferent, oblivious to the notion that the state should assist the family in a liberal social order. The disciples of Frederic Le Play, in La Reforme social, combined the defense of the family with “counter-revolutionary’’ demands, blaming the Civil Code, compulsory sharing, and revolutionary individualism while simultaneously extolling the virtues of the male-dominated family. These Le Playists exerted considerable influence on the conservative right and “social” Catholicism, but otherwise remained an isolated intellectual current. Elisee Reclus’ Nouvelle Geographic universelle (1877) reflected the more widespread sentiment that population decline indicated a “complete lack of confidence in the future,’’ a social malaise or even national decadence (Lukes 1972: 195). By 1896, Jacques Bertillon had founded the Alliance pour L’Accroisement de la Population Frangaise, and in his classic study of suicide just one year later, Durkheim insisted that both the decrease in births and the increase in suicides were the consequence of a decline in domestic feelings, an increase in migration from the country to the towns, the break-up of the traditional family, and the “cold wind of egoism’’ that had ensued (1888: 463; 1897: 198—202; Lukes 1972: 194—5).

对这种停滞的意识形态反应褒贬不一。地方当局和法国议会仍然完全无动于衷，无视国家应在自由的社会秩序中帮助家庭的观念。弗雷德里克 · 勒普雷(Frederic Le Play)在《改革社会》(a Reforme social)一书中将捍卫家庭与“反革命”要求结合起来，指责民法典、强制分享和革命性的个人主义，同时赞美男性主导的家庭的美德。这些游戏主义者对保守右翼和“社会”天主教产生了相当大的影响，但在其他方面仍然是一股孤立的思潮。Elisee Reclus 的《新地理世界》(1877)反映了一种更为普遍的情绪，即人口下降表明“对未来完全缺乏信心”，一种社会问题，甚至是国家衰落(Lukes 1972:195)。到了1896年，雅克 · 贝蒂隆(Jacques Bertillon)创立了法国人口增长联盟(Alliance pour L’Acroisement de la Population Frangaise) ，仅仅一年后，在他关于自杀的经典研究中，涂尔干坚持认为，出生率的下降和自杀率的上升都是国内情绪下降、从乡村向城镇迁移的增加、传统家庭的瓦解以及随之而来的“利己主义冷风”的结果(1888:463; 1897:198ー202; 卢克斯1972:194ー5)。

In fact, from 1871 on, 100,000 people left the countryside each year for the towns, a consequence of the difficulties of agriculture, the increase in agricultural yields (which deprived some peasants of their jobs), the decline of rural industries, better transportation, military service, and higher, more regular urban wages (Mayeur and Rebee rioux 1984: 44). But despite the fact that any agglomeration of more than 2,000 inhabitants was called a “town,” the urban population remained relatively small, forming 31.1 percent of the population in 1872 and only 40.9 percent by 1901 — a growth rate slower than that of any neighboring industrial country. The working population thus remained largely agricultural, constituting 67.5 percent of the total in 1876, and 61 percent as late as 1896. France was also a country of low demographic pressure, and thus one from which few people emigrated. Conversely, before and after 1876, the number of foreign immigrants in France rose from 800,000 to 1 million, and the relative stability of the latter ®gure thereafter must be understood in light of the naturalizations produced by the law of 1889. Italians, Belgians, Spaniards, and Germans settled either just inside the French border or in the urban, industrial regions, competing with French workers and, as the economic depression of the 1880s deepened, provoking xenophobic reactions in Lyons and Marseilles.

事实上，从1871年开始，每年有10万人离开农村进入城镇，这是农业困难的结果，农业产量的增加(剥夺了一些农民的工作) ，农村工业的衰落，更好的交通，兵役，以及更高的，更正常的城市工资(Mayeur and Rebee rioux 1984:44)。然而，尽管任何2000人以上的聚居区都被称为“城镇”，但城市人口仍然相对较少，在1872年占总人口的31.1% ，到1901年仅占40.9% ，增长速度低于任何邻近的工业国家。因此，劳动人口仍然以农业为主，在1876年占总人口的67.5% ，直到1896年占61% 。法国也是一个人口压力低的国家，因此很少有人移民。相反，在1876年之前和之后，在法国的外国移民人数从80万增加到100万，后者的相对稳定性必须根据1889年法律规定的归化程度来理解。意大利人、比利时人、西班牙人和德国人要么在法国边境内定居，要么在城市和工业区定居，与法国工人竞争，随着19世纪80年代经济萧条的加深，在里昂和马赛引发了排外反应。

Economic growth, which had been rapid before 1860 and steady if unspectacular for the twenty years thereafter, slowed dramatically after 1880, a consequence of the decreasing per capita productivity of the labor force and the declining rate of urbanization. With an annual growth of exports of 0.86 percent from 1875 to 1895 and her balance of payments in de®cit, France, once the second largest industrial power in the world, quickly slipped to fourth (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 46). Under these circumstances, the French aristocracy retained an undeniable prestige, but retained power only through those matrimonial alliances and corporate directorships which produced effective relations with the upper middle class. The power of the latter was derived from banking and industry, the liberal professions and service to the State. Heirs to the jurists and civil servants of the monarchy, the upper middle class was ideologically divided, some maintaining the Enlightenment belief in progress and loyalty to the Republic, while others were more attached to social “order” than to individual freedom, resigning themselves to a more pessimistic view of history consistent with both experience and the teachings of the Catholic Church.

经济增长在1860年之前一直很快，在此后的20年里即使不引人注目也是稳定的，但在1880年之后，由于劳动力人均生产率的下降和城市化速度的下降，经济增长急剧放缓。从1875年到1895年，法国的出口年增长率为0.86% ，国际收支平衡在德克萨斯州，曾经是世界第二大工业强国的法国迅速滑落到第四位(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:46)。在这种情况下，法国贵族保留了不可否认的威望，但只有通过与上层中产阶级产生有效关系的婚姻联盟和公司董事制度才能保留权力。后者的权力来自银行业和工业、自由职业和为国家服务。君主制的法学家和公务员的继承人，上层中产阶级在意识形态上是分裂的，一些人坚持启蒙运动时期对进步的信仰和对共和国的忠诚，而另一些人更倾向于社会“秩序”而不是个人自由，他们屈服于一种更加悲观的历史观，这种观点与天主教会的经验和教义相一致。

The more “ordinary” middle class included bankers in small towns, industrialists with moderate-sized enterprises, unemployed landlords, members of the liberal professions, salaried magistrates, officers, engineers, and teachers like Durkheim. Enjoying a stable currency and no income tax, the urban bourgeois with an annual income of 20,000 francs paid as little as 2 percent in taxes. A doctor, lawyer, or engineer who had been prudent under the prosperity of the Second Empire could retire in his fifties with no decline in his standard of living, a prospect which gave rise to the unregulated aspirations symptomatic of Durkheim's “economic anomie'' (1897: 254—8). “Conservatives of the time,'' Mayeur and Reberioux warn us, “like to assert that the individualism bred by the Revolution had undermined the family, but in fact family feeling had changed rather than weakened. The bourgeois family looked inward, concentrating on the child and his future. It was a family of limited births, anxious to rise in the world through birth control and saving'' (1984: 71).

更“普通”的中产阶级包括小城镇的银行家、拥有中等规模企业的实业家、失业的地主、自由职业者、受薪的地方法官、官员、工程师以及涂尔干这样的教师。年收入20,000法郎的城市资产阶级享有稳定的货币和免征所得税，缴纳的税率仅为2% 。在第二帝国的繁荣时期，一个谨慎的医生、律师或工程师可以在五十多岁退休，生活水平不会下降，这种前景引发了迪尔凯姆的“经济失范”(1897:254ー8)所表现出的不受约束的愿望。Mayeur 和 Reberioux 警告我们: “当时的保守主义者喜欢断言，革命孕育的个人主义破坏了家庭，但事实上，家庭感觉已经改变而不是削弱了。资产阶级家庭只关注自己的内心，把注意力集中在孩子和他的未来上。这是一个生育率有限的家庭，急于通过节育和储蓄来提高在世界上的地位”(1984:71)。

The lower middle class comprised those small building contractors, small employers, independent craftsmen, and retail shopkeepers who lacked the education and/or income of the ordinary middle class, yet avoided manual labor and retained an economic independence which distinguished them from the rural or industrial worker. Less independent, though still removed from manual labor, were the wage-earning clerks, accountants, civil servants, primary school teachers and tax-collectors who were paid little but enjoyed stable employment and a pension. Most important, it was this group — growing in size as the depression decimated the independent lower middle class — which, together with the small town and the provincial school, provided a largely republican road from peasantry to bourgeoisie: “The peasant's son,'' Mayeur and Reberioux observe, “was a school-teacher or a clerk; his grandson could become a doctor or a graduate of a technical college and thus join the bourgeoisie proper. The lower middle classes were a half-way stage between the rural population and the elites.'' “It was the good fortune of the Republic,'' they add, “and one of the reasons why it took root, to have thus offered numerous jobs to a social stratum anxious to rise in the world'' (1984: 70).

下层中产阶级包括小型建筑承包商、小型雇主、独立工匠和零售店主，他们缺乏普通中产阶级的教育和/或收入，但避免体力劳动，并保持经济独立，这使他们区别于农村或工业工人。不那么独立的，虽然仍然远离体力劳动，是挣工资的办事员，会计，公务员，小学教师和税务员，他们收入很少，但享有稳定的工作和养老金。最重要的是，正是这个群体ーー随着经济大萧条摧毁了独立的下层中产阶级，他们的规模不断扩大ーー与小城镇和地方学校一起，为从农民到资产阶级提供了一条基本上属于共和主义的道路: “农民的儿子,”梅耶尔和雷贝里乌说，“是学校的老师或职员; 他的孙子可以成为一名医生或技术学院的毕业生，从而加入资产阶级的行列。下层中产阶级是农村人口与精英阶层之间的中间阶段。”“这是共和国的幸运,”他们补充道，“也是它生根的原因之一，因为它为渴望在世界上崛起的社会阶层提供了大量的工作”(1984:70)。

The industrial working class was very small, numbering less than 5 million in the 1870s, and only 6 million by 1900. Except for Paris and the industrial south-east, there were no real spatial concentrations of workers, and the majority were employed by extremely small industrial establishments. To speak of “the conditions of the working class'' is thus quite difficult, for these conditions varied widely depending upon geographical location, skills, education, and ethnic and historical traditions. But a few conditions — the absence of savings and security, the difficulty of access to education and culture, and, above all, the spectre of unemployment during the years of the great depression — were experienced by all. The working class was thus primarily agricultural, and remained so until the end of the century. But the living conditions, manners, and mentality of the peasants changed. Railways, especially the little cross-country lines, and improvements in local roads, went far to break down provincial isolation. The town was easier to reach, and its culture was felt through the schools, compulsory military service, mail-order catalogues, and cheap newspapers. If not for themselves, the agricultural working class could at least anticipate an easier, less trying life for their children and their children's children (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 50, 53-4, 45).

工业工人阶级人数很少，19世纪70年代不到500万，到1900年只有600万。除了巴黎和工业东南部，没有真正的工人空间集中，大多数工人受雇于极小的工业企业。因此，谈到“工人阶级的条件”是相当困难的，因为这些条件因地理位置、技能、教育以及种族和历史传统的不同而有很大的差异。但是，所有人都经历过一些情况，包括缺乏储蓄和安全、难以获得教育和文化，以及最重要的是，大萧条时期出现了失业的幽灵。因此，工人阶级主要从事农业生产，并一直持续到本世纪末。但是农民的生活条件、生活方式、生活心态发生了变化。铁路，尤其是小型的跨国铁路线，以及当地道路的改善，在很大程度上打破了省内的孤立状态。这个城镇更容易到达，通过学校、义务兵役制、邮购目录和廉价报纸可以感受到它的文化。如果不是为了他们自己，农业工人阶级至少可以为他们的孩子和他们孩子的孩子预期一个更容易，少尝试的生活(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:50,53-4,45)。

In sum, from the early days of the Third Republic until the end of the century, French society was to change very little, and least of all in its traditional social and economic inequalities. Durkheim’s consistently uniformitarian view that revolutions are as rare as unicorns thus reflected not only his deeply conservative nature but also a keen perception of the realities of his own society. In fact, those who made the republican victory possible - the peasantry and the rising middle class - expected no profound transformation of social relations. What they did expect was the end of the political influence of the traditional upper class as well as the Catholic Church, for this in turn would provide them with at least the opportunity to rise socially.

总之，从第三共和国初期到本世纪末，法国社会变化很小，尤其是在传统的社会和经济不平等方面。涂尔干始终如一地坚持“革命就像独角兽一样稀少”的观点，这不仅反映了他极端保守的天性，也反映了他对自己社会现实的敏锐洞察力。事实上，那些使共和制胜利成为可能的人——农民和正在崛起的中产阶级——并不期望社会关系发生深刻的变化。他们所期待的是传统上层阶级以及天主教会的政治影响力的终结，因为这反过来将至少为他们提供社会地位上升的机会。

These expectations were intimately bound to the precarious future of the Third Republic. On July 19, 1870, the government of Napoleon III had declared war on Prussia. By September 2, after the battle of Sedan, the technically backward French army had surrendered, and Napoleon himself was taken prisoner. Two days later, the Second Empire destroyed, Paris insurrectionaries led by Leon Gambetta and Jules Simon established a “Government of National Defense,’’ and, following the precedents of 1792 and 1848, declared the Republic. Prussian forces laid siege to Paris and, by September 23, had severed its contact with the outside world. Paris held out for another four months, as Gambetta formed a provincial “Army of the Loire’’ in support; but on January 28, Paris capitulated, and a furious Gambetta resigned rather than stage a provincial coup.

这些期望与第三共和国岌岌可危的未来密切相关。1870年7月19日，拿破仑三世政府向普鲁士宣战。到了9月2日，在色当战役之后，技术落后的法国军队投降了，拿破仑本人也被俘虏了。两天后，第二帝国被摧毁，由里昂 · 甘贝塔和朱尔斯 · 西蒙领导的巴黎起义者建立了一个“国防政府”，并遵循1792年和1848年的先例，宣布成立共和国。普鲁士军队包围了巴黎，并在9月23日切断了与外界的联系。巴黎又坚持了四个月，甘贝塔组建了一支省级“卢瓦尔军”来支持; 但是在1月28日，巴黎投降了，愤怒的甘贝塔辞职了，而不是发动一场省级政变。

Since France now possessed no government with which Bismarck could negotiate, he insisted on the election of a Constituent Assembly by universal male suffrage. The election, held on February 8, 1871, showed that again, as in 1797 and 1848, France - and especially the peasantry - distrusted republicanism. Of 645 persons elected in the various departments, 400 were monarchists, and nearly half of these were landowners. Suspected of bellicosity abroad and instability at home, of opposition to the Church, and of egalitarian and even socialist tendencies, republicans won only 200 seats. “So now we have a republic?” observed Zola’s peasant-hero Jean Macquart, in La Debacle (1892). “Oh well, all to the good if it helps us beat the Prussians’’; but then Macquart shook his head, “for he had always been led to fear a republic when he worked on the land. And besides, in the face of the enemy he didn’t think it was a good thing not to be all of one mind’’ (1972: 403).

由于法国现在没有可以与俾斯麦谈判的政府，他坚持由男性普选产生制宪议会。1871年2月8日举行的选举再次表明，如同1797年和1848年一样，法国——尤其是农民——不信任共和主义。在各省当选的645人中，有400人是君主主义者，其中近一半是地主。怀疑好战的国外和不稳定的国内，反对教会，平等主义，甚至社会主义倾向，共和党只赢得了200个席位。“现在我们有了共和国?”左拉笔下的农民英雄让 · 麦夸特(Jean Macquart)在《大溃败》(La Debacle，1892年)中如是说。“哦，好吧，如果这能帮助我们打败普鲁士人，那就太好了。”但是麦考特摇了摇头，“因为他在这片土地上工作的时候，总是被引导着去害怕一个共和国。此外，面对敌人，他认为不团结一致不是一件好事”(1972:403)。

The prospects for a restoration, however, were complicated by the fragmentation of the Right. The Bonapartists, the biggest losers at Sedan, returned only 20 supporters from Corsica and the two Charente departments. On the extreme Right, approximately 80 members of the Assembly supported the restoration of the Bourbon comte de Chambord; but these extremists, whose support came from rural France and the Catholic Workers’ Circles founded in 1871 by Albert de Mun, were ultramontane on religious matters, defended the Syllabus and papal infallibility, and hoped to see Pius IX (then imprisoned in the Vatican) restored to his temporal powers. “Men of principle to whom politics were alien,’’ Mayeur and Reberioux observe, “they were to be awkward elements in coalitions of the right. Accustomed to read events as decrees of providence, they would not hesitate on occasion to follow the worst possible policy, being convinced that the renewal of Catholic France would only come about through catastrophe” (1984: 11). Distinguished from the extreme Right by its acceptance of parliamentary government, political and even economic liberalism, was a “center Right’’ of moderate legitimists. Religiously, this group had given up its Vol-tairean tone of the 1830s, and many had become liberal Catholics; but, while this separated them from the extreme Right (they had been disappointed with Pius IX’s proclamation of the Syllabus and papal infallibility), they insisted that the State maintain respect for the Catholic Church. This in turn distinguished them from a group with which they otherwise had much in common — i.e., a “center Left’’ of Orleanists, suspicious of the Church, and led by Adolphe Thiers, for whom the elections of 1871 proved a personal triumph.

然而，右翼的分裂使恢复的前景变得复杂。波拿巴艺术家是色当的最大输家，他们只从科西嘉岛和夏朗德河两个部门带回了20名支持者。在极右翼方面，大约80名国会议员支持恢复波旁伯爵宫; 但是这些极端分子，他们的支持来自法国农村地区和阿尔伯特 · 德 · 门于1871年创立的天主教工人团体，在宗教问题上是超蒙的，他们捍卫教学大纲和教皇的绝对正确性，并希望看到庇护九世(当时被关押在梵蒂冈)恢复他的世俗权力。梅耶尔和雷贝里乌说: “政治对有原则的人来说是陌生的，他们是右翼联盟中的尴尬因素。他们习惯于将事件解读为上帝的旨意，有时会毫不犹豫地采取最糟糕的政策，坚信天主教法国的复兴只能通过灾难来实现。”(1984:11)。与极右派不同的是，他们接受了议会政府，政治上甚至是经济自由主义，他们是温和的合法主义者中的“中间右派”。在宗教上，这个团体已经放弃了19世纪30年代的伏尔泰语调，许多人已经成为自由派天主教徒; 但是，尽管这使他们与极右派分离(他们对庇护九世宣布的教学大纲和教皇的绝对正确感到失望) ，他们坚持国家应该保持对天主教会的尊重。这反过来又使他们区别于一个在其他方面有很多共同点的团体ーー即，一个对教会持怀疑态度的 Orleanists“中左派”，由阿道夫 · 蒂尔斯(adolph Thiers)领导，1871年的选举证明了他个人的胜利。

An elder statesman of 73, Thiers had been a leader of the Opposition and a sharp critic of Napoleon Ill’s foreign policies since 1863. Although he refused to join the Government of National Defense (it contained far too many republicans), he had demonstrated his patriotism by serving on several diplomatic missions on its behalf. As the only political figure whose reputation emerged unscathed from the disasters of 1870-1, he was elected in 26 different departments. In the Pact of Bordeaux of February 17, 1871, Thiers was appointed “head of the executive authority of the French Republic” and “under the control of the Assembly,” a deliberately ambiguous title and description designed to avoid prejudice with respect to the eventual form of government France might decide to adopt. The National Assembly was but temporarily a “repository of the sovereign authority,” and was to act only “provisionally” until “a decision was taken on the institutions of France.” In sum, the government was only very precariously a “republic” at all.

作为一位73岁的老政治家，泰尔斯自1863年以来一直是反对党的领袖，也是拿破仑三世外交政策的尖锐批评者。虽然他拒绝加入国防政府(国防政府中有太多的共和党人) ，但是他已经通过代表国防政府在几个外交使团中服务来证明他的爱国主义精神。作为唯一一位声誉未受1870-1871年灾难影响的政治人物，他在26个不同的部门当选。在1871年2月17日的《波尔多条约》中，蒂耶斯被任命为“法兰西共和国行政当局的首脑”和“在议会的控制之下”，这是一个故意模棱两可的头衔和描述，旨在避免对法国可能决定采取的最终政府形式产生偏见。国民议会只是暂时的一个“主权权威的宝库”，并且只是“暂时的”行动，直到“对法国的机构作出决定”总而言之，政府只是一个非常不稳定的“共和国”。

The French government thus established, Bismarck insisted on the harshest of terms: an indemnity of 5 billion gold francs (to be paid within three years), an army of occupation in twenty departments, and the annexation of Alsace and most of Lorraine.1 When the newly elected National Assembly accepted these terms on March 1, 1871, the result was the outbreak of revolutionary violence known as the Paris Commune. Thiers transferred his government to Versailles, Paris was left in the hands of the Communards, and civil war ensued. When the Commune was at last suppressed and order restored on May 28, 1871, the National Assembly dealt ruthlessly with the revolutionaries: 20,000 were executed, 38,000 taken prisoner, 13,450 sentenced to various prison terms and 7,500 deported to New Caledonia. But for the Paris Commune and its ruthless suppression, however, the birth of the Third Republic might have been still more difficult than it was. On the one hand, the proscription and exile of so many “extremists” provided the nascent and extremely precarious Republic an opportunity to evolve in a more peaceful, orderly fashion, and even to attain a degree of constitutional legitimacy. On the other hand, the absence (or at least quiescence) of these same elements helped to remove the long-held association of republicanism with violence, instability, and disorder -something essential if the Republic were to win the allegiance of its hard-working, law-abiding, and largely provincial citizenry.

法国政府由此建立，俾斯麦坚持最苛刻的条件: 赔偿50亿金法郎(三年内支付) ，占领20个省的军队，并吞并 Alsace 和大部分洛林地区。1当新当选的国民议会在1871年3月1日接受这些条件时，结果是爆发了被称为巴黎公社的革命暴力。泰尔斯将他的政府转移到凡尔赛，巴黎被留在公社的手中，内战接踵而至。1871年5月28日，当公社最终被镇压并恢复秩序时，国民议会对革命者进行了残酷的处理: 20000人被处决，38000人被关押，13450人被判处不同的刑期，7500人被驱逐到新喀里多尼亚。然而，对于巴黎公社及其无情的镇压，第三共和国的诞生可能仍然比以前更加困难。一方面，如此多的“极端分子”遭到禁止和流放，为这个新生的、极其不稳定的共和国提供了一个机会，使其能够以一种更加和平、有序的方式发展，甚至获得一定程度的宪法合法性。另一方面，这些元素的缺失(或者至少是静止)有助于消除长期以来共和主义与暴力、不稳定和混乱的联系——如果共和国想要赢得其勤劳、守法和大部分地方公民的忠诚，这是必不可少的。1

In May, 1871, however, the position of France within the larger European community was hardly encouraging, particularly by contrast with its apparent fortunes just ®fteen years earlier. At the conclusion of the Crimean War (1854-6), J. P. T Bury has observed, Great Britain was an ally, Russia had been ®rmly defeated, Italy and Germany were simply “geographical expressions,” and France was incontestably the foremost power in Europe. By the spring of 1871, Britain was no longer an ally (indeed, France had no allies); Russia had gained a modi®cation of the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris; without any quid pro quo, France had been forced to withdraw her troops from Italy, allowing the Italian government to occupy Rome, complete the uni®cation of Italy, imprison Pius IX in the Vatican, and end the temporal power of the papacy; and, worst of all, Germany, whose population already outnumbered France by more than 4 million people, had achieved national unity, declared itself an Empire, and would soon become the greatest industrial power on the Continent. “The hegemony of Europe,” Bury concludes, “had passed from France to Germany, and Bismarck, not Thiers, was now the chief arbiter of continental disputes” (1985: 135).

然而，在1871年5月，法国在更大的欧洲共同体中的地位并不令人鼓舞，特别是与其15年前明显的命运形成鲜明对比。在克里米亚战争(1854-1856)结束时，J · P · T · 伯里(J.P.T。 Burry)观察到，大不列颠是盟友，俄罗斯被彻底击败，意大利和德国只是“地理表现”，法国无疑是欧洲最重要的力量。到1871年春，英国不再是盟友(事实上，法国没有盟友) ; 俄国修改了《巴黎条约》中的黑海条款; 没有任何交换条件，法国被迫从意大利撤军，允许意大利政府占领罗马，完成意大利的统一，将庇护九世囚禁在梵蒂冈，终结教皇的世俗权力; 最糟糕的是，人口已经超过法国400万的德国实现了国家统一，宣布自己是一个帝国，并将很快成为欧洲大陆上最大的工业强国。“欧洲的霸权,”伯里总结道，“已经从法国转移到德国，俾斯麦，而不是蒂尔斯，现在是大陆争端的主要仲裁者”(1985:135)。

For the French, the natural consequences of this situation included a revulsion for war, a powerful desire for peace and order, the constant af®rmation and re-af®rmation of patriotism, the elevation of the “sacred” French army to a status beyond political argument altogether, and an utter indifference to the restoration of the temporal power of the Pope. Henceforth, public opinion would favor those like Durkheim, whose republican zeal was tempered by opposition to insurrection and revolution. In the by-elections of July 2, 1871, such republicans, including 35 radicals, captured 100 seats while the royalists gained only 12. For the most part, this was a vote for the conservative republic of Thiers, or the “moderate Left” led by Jules Simon, Jules Grevy, Jules Ferry, and Jules Favre - successful bourgeois who desired peace and rejected the Republican Union radicals led by Gambetta. But Gambetta himself was re-elected in Paris, indicating that conservatives had failed to identify the radical left with the Commune, and also that their success in February had been more the result of a desire for peace than a desire for monarchy.

对法国人来说，这种情况的自然结果包括对战争的厌恶，对和平与秩序的强烈渴望，对爱国主义的不断强化，将“神圣”的法国军队提升到完全超越政治争论的地位，以及对恢复教皇的世俗权力的完全漠不关心。从此以后，公众舆论会偏向于迪尔凯姆这样的人，他们的共和热情被反对起义和革命所调和。在1871年7月2日的补选中，这些共和党人，包括35名激进分子，获得了100个席位，而保皇党只获得了12个席位。在大多数情况下，这是对保守共和国蒂尔斯，或“温和左派”领导的朱尔斯西蒙，朱尔斯格雷维，朱尔斯费里和朱尔斯法弗尔投票，成功的资产阶级谁渴望和平，拒绝共和联盟的激进分子甘贝塔领导。但甘贝塔本人在巴黎再次当选，这表明保守派未能认同公社中的激进左派，而且他们在2月份的成功更多地是出于对和平的渴望，而非对君主制的渴望。

The “very type of the prudent bourgeois,” Thiers approached the problems of reconstruction in a conservative, business-like manner. The prosperous years of the Second Empire providing a substantial degree of economic resilience, the two loans raised to meet Bismarck’s “crushing” war indemnity were easily and quickly covered and, by December 1873, the entire country was cleared of German soldiers. A proposal to introduce an income tax was dismissed and, under the stress of competition from the New World, Thiers initiated the first steps toward a return to the protectionism characteristic of France before i860. “The Republic will be conservative,” Thiers explained, “or it will not be at all’’ — an attitude no doubt reassuring to the rising middle class and its ever-swelling ranks of investors (Bury 1985: 137).

作为“非常谨慎的资产阶级”，蒂尔斯以一种保守的、务实的态度处理重建问题。第二帝国的繁荣岁月提供了相当程度的经济弹性，用来支付俾斯麦“毁灭性”战争赔款的两笔贷款很容易就能迅速偿还，到1873年12月，整个国家的德国士兵都被清除了。一项引入所得税的提议被驳回，在来自新世界的竞争压力下，蒂尔斯开始迈出第一步，重新回到 i860之前法国特有的保护主义。“共和国将是保守的,”蒂尔斯解释说，“否则它将一点也不保守。”这种态度无疑会让正在崛起的中产阶级及其不断壮大的投资者群体感到安心(Burry 1985:137)。

Similarly, any illusions that the demise of the Empire would result in the dismantling of the highly centralized Napoleonic administrative structure were quickly dispelled, as the traditionalist Thiers refused to allow free election of mayors in any but towns of under 20,000 inhabitants, and neither he nor his successors made any attempt to limit the powers of the Prefecture of Police. While efforts to reform the French army on the model of its demonstrably superior Prussian counterpart were always subservient to the interests of the economy, the latter were sufficiently auspicious by 1875 to permit passage of a bill providing for an increase of 150,000 men, and serious discussion of more modernized equipment and the development of a reserve. When the increasingly voluble revanchiste sentiments which accompanied these measures led Bismarck to rattle his sword in the German press, the Foreign Minister Decazes successfully aroused the diplomatic intercession of both Britain and Russia on France’s behalf, demonstrating that for all its success in 1870—1, Germany had no carte blanche on the Continent.

同样，任何认为帝国的灭亡将导致拿破仑高度集权的行政结构的解体的幻想都很快被驱散，因为传统主义者蒂埃尔拒绝允许任何城市的市长自由选举，除了2万居民以下的城镇，他和他的继任者都没有试图限制巴黎警察厅的权力。虽然改革法国军队的努力，以其明显优越的普鲁士军队为模式，总是服从于经济利益，但是后者在1875年十分有利，允许通过一项法案，规定增加150,000人，并认真讨论更现代化的装备和发展后备力量。当这些措施所带来的日益高涨的复仇情绪导致俾斯麦在德国媒体上挥舞他的剑时，外交部长迪卡泽斯成功地促使英国和俄罗斯代表法国进行外交斡旋，表明尽管德国在1870年1月取得了成功，但在欧洲大陆上并没有全权委托的权力。

This conservative, provisional Republic was one that moderate legitimists could at least temporarily swallow. What was less palatable was Gambetta’s republican radicals, whose resurgence was increasingly evident in repeated by-election victories, the founding of the newspaper La Republic frangaise (1871), and Gambetta’s own charismatic presence at numerous political banquets throughout the country. But in fact, Gambetta, who in 1869 had subscribed to the famous Belleville electoral program, was rapidly becoming more moderate. In particular, he acknowledged the imminent rise of what he called “a new social stratum’’ — petits bourgeois, shopkeepers, clerks, and artisans — the class which had pro®ted from the prosperity of the Second Empire, swelled the ranks of investors in the provisional Republic, and thus accelerated the work of post-war reconstruction; and now, given the appropriate education and opportunity, this class would surely support the Republic and strengthen its institutions (Thomson 1968: 79, 82±4; Bury 1985: 150).

这个保守的临时共和国至少可以让温和的合法主义者暂时接受。甘贝塔的共和激进分子就不那么讨人喜欢了，他们的复兴在一次又一次的补选胜利、《法兰克福共和国报》(La Republic frangaise，1871年)的创办以及甘贝塔本人在全国各地众多政治宴会上的魅力表现中越来越明显。但事实上，甘贝塔在1869年签署了著名的贝尔维尔选举计划后，很快就变得更加温和了。特别是，他承认他所谓的“新的社会阶层”即将崛起ーー小资产阶级、店主、职员和工匠ーー这个阶层从第二帝国的繁荣中受益，扩大了临时共和国的投资者队伍，从而加快了战后重建的工作; 现在，如果有适当的教育和机会，这个阶层肯定会支持共和国并加强其制度(Thomson 1968:79,82 ± 4; Burry 1985:150)。

In short, Gambetta ceased to be a Radical and became what he himself described as an “Opportunist” ± a name which would characterize the moderate Left to the end of the century. Doctrinaire tenets were shelved in the interest of practical ends, and the electorate was increasingly reassured that, if Gambetta remained a republican and an anticlerical, he was no revolutionary. In fact, those who insist on reading De la division du travail social as a “dialogue” with Marx’s ghost should be reminded that revolutionary socialism was virtually non-existent at the parliamentary level of French politics during the period in which that work was conceived.[2](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark13) The ®rst series of Jules Guesde’s L'Egalite appeared only in November 1877, and the second in January 1880. Between the two, the Socialist Workers’ Congress of France was held at Marseilles (October 1879), denouncing Gambetta’s followers and adopting a Marxist program. But the actual texts of Marx and Engels were almost unknown, and only in 1885 did Guesde’s Parti ouvrier publish a complete translation of the Communist Manifesto.

简而言之，甘贝塔不再是一个激进分子，而是成为了他自己所说的“机会主义者”，这个名字将成为本世纪末温和的左派的特征。为了实际目的，教条主义的信条被搁置起来，选民们越来越确信，如果甘贝塔仍然是一个共和党人和反教士的人，他就不是革命者。事实上，那些坚持把社会分工作为与马克思鬼魂的“对话”来解读的人应该记住，革命性的社会主义在构思这部作品的时期，在法国政治的议会层面实际上是不存在的。2朱尔斯 · 格斯德(Jules Guesde)的《平等》(L’Egalite)的第一个系列只出现在1877年11月，第二个系列出现在1880年1月。在两者之间，法国社会主义工人代表大会在马赛举行(1879年10月) ，谴责甘贝塔的追随者，并采用了马克思主义的纲领。但是马克思和恩格斯的实际文本几乎是不为人知的，直到1885年，格斯德的党工作者才出版了一本完整的共产党宣言译本。

The reasons for this quiescence, in sharp contrast to the powerful Social Democratic Party in Germany, are not far to seek. France, as we have seen, was still a country of peasants rather than urban-industrial workers, and those Paris revolutionaries who had survived the suppression of the Commune were either in prison or in exile, not to be pardoned until 1879. Even after the republican victory of 1879, when most of Gambetta’s erstwhile radicals joined the opposition in their hatred for Ferry and the Opportunists, the extreme Left remained irretrievably split. A group led by Charles Floquet and Henri Allain-Targe, which (paradoxically) called itself “the parliamentary group of the radical Left,’’ demanded revision of the constitution, abolition of the Senate and the Presidency of the Republic, administrative decentralization, election of judges, and separation of Church and State; but their reforms remained primarily political rather than social in nature. The socialists themselves split over party organization (unitary or federal?) and tactics (revolutionary or reformist?) at St. Etienne in 1882. The Marxist followers of Guesde joined the Parti ouvrier, while the “possibilists” - those who wished to practice “the politics of the possible,” and for whom the Republic took precedence over the class struggle - formed the Federations des travailleurs socialistes. And in the rural south-east, the disciples of Louis-Auguste Blanqui and Edouard Vaillant formed the Comite revolutionnaire central (1881), a closed group of anarchist “companions” who rejected politics altogether. In short, apart from the conquest of a few town halls, “the various brands of socialism scarcely counted on the political level'' (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 75).

与强大的德国社会民主党形成鲜明对比的是，这种平静的原因并不遥远。正如我们所看到的，法国仍然是一个农民的国家，而不是城市工业工人的国家，那些在公社镇压下幸存下来的巴黎革命者要么在监狱里，要么流亡在外，直到1879年才被赦免。即使在1879年共和党取得胜利之后，当时甘贝塔过去的激进分子中的大多数加入了反对派阵营，憎恨费里和机会主义者，极左派仍然存在着不可挽回的分裂。一个由查尔斯 · 弗洛奎和亨利 · 阿兰-塔吉领导的组织，自称为“激进左派的议会集团”，要求修改宪法，废除参议院和共和国总统制，行政地方分权，选举法官和教会与国家关系，但他们的改革主要是政治性的，而不是社会性的。社会主义者自己在党组织(统一的还是联邦的?)上分裂和策略(革命者还是改革者?)1882年在 St. Etienne。Guesde 的马克思主义追随者加入了工人党，而“可能性主义者”——那些希望实践“可能的政治”的人，对他们来说，共和国优先于阶级斗争——组成了社会主义工人联合会。在东南部的农村地区，路易-奥古斯特 · 布兰基(Louis-Auguste Blanqui)和爱德华 · 韦兰(Edouard Vaillant)的门徒们组成了中央委员会(Comite) ，这是一个封闭的无政府主义“同伴”团体，他们完全拒绝政治。简而言之，除了征服几个市政厅之外，“社会主义的各种品牌几乎没有在政治层面上得到体现”(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:75)。

As Mayeur and Reberioux have emphasized, the problem of explaining the republican victory is largely one of asking the right question. If we ask why the efforts at restoration failed, for example, the answer is both obvious and unhelpful. They failed because both the peasantry and the Orleanist legitimists feared the comte de Chambord more than they feared the Republic. If we ask why the constitutional laws were passed, the answer is equally obvious and equally unhelpful. They were passed because they were a temporary expedient, providing a conservative, parliamentary form of government while the Orleanists awaited their opportunity to establish a liberal monarchy. The much better question, therefore, is why this provisional, centrist government was gradually undermined by a widening rift between republicans and conservatives, and eventually gave way to a new “coalition of the Third Estate” (1984: 36—7).

正如梅耶尔和雷贝里乌所强调的，解释共和党的胜利在很大程度上是一个提出正确问题的问题。例如，如果我们问为什么修复工作失败了，答案显而易见，而且毫无帮助。他们失败了，因为农民和奥尔良合法主义者都害怕香波伯爵，而不是共和国。如果我们问为什么宪法法律被通过，答案同样显而易见，同样没有帮助。它们之所以获得通过，是因为它们只是暂时的权宜之计，提供了一种保守的议会形式的政府，而奥尔良学派正在等待建立自由君主制的机会。因此，更好的问题是，为什么这个临时的中间派政府逐渐被共和党和保守党之间日益扩大的分歧所削弱，并最终让位于一个新的“第三阶层联盟”(1984:36ー7)。

What, then, gave rise to this rift and, eventually, this coalition? The effort to depict the conflict between republicans and conservatives as one of social class is doomed to failure; for in fact, the breadth of republican appeal largely transcended such divisions. A substantial number of upper middle-class bankers, businessmen, and industrialists, for example, had long been enamored of the ideas of Saint-Simon and Comte, embraced the faith in social progress, and firmly believed that a society open to talent and ability was the best means to ensure it. No less supportive of the Republic was Gambet-ta’s “new social stratum” — the group produced by the economic prosperity of the Second Empire - which now sought secular enlightenment and social advancement for their children. The support of the peasantry — more fearful of both revolution and reaction — might not be taken for granted; but republican propaganda, which succeeded in raising fears of clerical reaction and/or the restoration of monarchy, combined with republican promises of free, secular education and universal military service, proved increasingly seductive. Finally, the industrial working class — never a decisive element in the coalition in any case — voted for the Republic if it voted at all (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 37—40).

那么，是什么导致了这种分歧，并最终导致了这种联盟呢？把共和党人和保守党人之间的冲突描绘成社会阶层的一部分的努力注定要失败，因为事实上，共和党人的吸引力在很大程度上超越了这种分歧。例如，相当数量的上层中产阶级银行家、商人和实业家，长期以来一直迷恋圣西蒙和孔德的思想，信奉社会进步的信念，并坚信一个向人才和能力开放的社会是确保社会进步的最佳手段。同样支持共和国的还有甘贝塔的“新社会阶层”(由第二帝国的经济繁荣产生的群体) ，他们现在为自己的子女寻求世俗启蒙和社会进步。农民更害怕革命和反抗，他们的支持可能不是理所当然的; 但共和党的宣传，成功地引起了人们对神职人员反抗和/或恢复君主制的恐惧，加上共和党对免费、世俗教育和普遍服兵役的承诺，证明越来越具有诱惑力。最后，工业工人阶级ーー无论如何都不是联合政府中的决定性因素ーー如果共和国投票的话，他们也会投票支持它(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:37-40)。

This breadth of appeal helps to explain at least two noteworthy features of the policies of the republicans once in power. The first, as both their Roman Catholic and (later) their radical socialist opponents pointed out, was that the Opportunists had no social policy whatsoever — i.e., no intention of significantly altering the traditional class structure of French society. On the contrary, aside from some early public works programs for the construction of ports, canals, and railways, the characteristic republican posture was one of resistance to State intervention in the economy, support for agriculture and protectionist industry, and aggressive colonialism (Bury 1985: 152; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 94). When Ferry revealed his plan for a society “without God or King,” therefore, Jaures was wont to observe that this did not exclude the factory owner (McManners 1972: 46). The reasons for this exclusively political nature of the republican refor ms are obvious. France was still a land of peasants — 65 percent of the population were still country dwellers — who had little direct interest in the social problems of workers. Those who were interested (and had survived the suppression of the Commune) were either in prison or in exile, while the remaining republicans were, like Ferry and Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, themselves bourgeois who distrusted social change. Finally, the republican ascendancy itself was palpably the consequence of coalition politics, depending heavily on the gradual seduction of the peasantry and the conversion of important Orleanists like Thiers. Had serious social and economic change played a part in the republican agenda, this seduction and conversion would clearly have been undermined (Bury, 1985: 152—3). These were caveats to which Durkheim was not oblivious. Although a friend of Jaures and sympathetic to socialism, his response to revolutionary proposals, simply and repeatedly, was “I fear a reaction” (Lukes 1972: 323).

这种吸引力的广度至少有助于解释共和党执政时期政策的两个值得注意的特点。第一，正如他们的罗马天主教徒和(后来)他们的激进社会主义对手所指出的那样，机会主义者没有任何社会政策ーー也就是说，他们无意显著改变法国社会的传统阶级结构。相反，除了一些早期建设港口、运河和铁路的公共工程项目，共和党的特色姿态是抵制国家干预经济、支持农业和保护主义工业以及侵略性殖民主义(Burry 1985:152; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:94)。因此，当费里透露他计划建立一个“没有上帝和国王”的社会时，Jaures 通常会观察到这并不排除工厂主(麦克曼纳斯1972:46)。共和党保守党这种纯粹的政治性质的原因是显而易见的。法国仍然是一片农民的土地ーー65% 的人口仍然是农村居民ーー他们对工人的社会问题没有什么直接的兴趣。那些感兴趣的人(在公社镇压下幸存下来的人)要么被关进监狱，要么被流放，而剩下的共和党人，像费里和奥古斯特 · 舍伊尔-凯斯特纳，他们自己就是不信任社会变革的资产阶级。最后，共和政体本身的优势显然是联合政治的结果，这在很大程度上取决于对农民的逐渐诱惑和像蒂尔斯这样的重要奥尔良学派的转变。如果严重的社会和经济变革在共和党的议程中占有一席之地，这种诱惑和转变显然会受到破坏(伯里，1985:152ー3)。这些都是涂尔干没有忘记的警告。虽然他是 Jaures 的朋友，同情社会主义，但他对革命建议的反应，简单而反复，是“我害怕一个反应”(路加福音1972:323)。

THE NEW ANTICLERICALISM

新的反强权主义

The second noteworthy feature was the central place of laicization within these political reforms. One has to read Gambetta's speech of May 4, 1877, Langlois observes, in order to understand “what remains, after one hundred years, astonishing: that it was indeed the denunciation of clericalism that held the republican camp together'' (1996: 117). In fact, the conflict between republicans and conservatives was largely an ideological one over the place of the Church in French society. In particular, the Church was held responsible for denying both the middle classes and the peasantry that “enlightenment” which had been the promise of the French Revolution. In a sense, therefore, the defeat of the conservatives and the republican ascendancy marked the culmination of the great movement which had been begun in 1789 (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 37). The historic alliance of Church and State in France was based upon the Concordat of 1801, a settlement signed by a Bonaparte wary of a Catholic reaction against a “godless” Republic and a Pius VII eager to heal the schism between “refractory” and “constitutional” clergy. Both parties gained. On his side, the pope received the right to depose French bishops and discipline pro-revolutionary clergy, thus ending the autonomy of the pre-revolutionary Gallican church. Henceforth, the head of State would nominate bishops, to whom the pope would then grant canonical institution. The publicity of Catholic worship, in such forms as processions in the streets, was again permitted; and Church seminaries were allowed to re-open.

第二个值得注意的特点是，在这些政治改革中，俗化处于中心地位。朗格洛伊斯观察到，人们必须阅读甘贝塔1877年5月4日的讲话，才能理解“一百年后仍然令人震惊的是: 正是对教权主义的谴责将共和党阵营团结在一起”(1996:117)。事实上，共和党和保守党之间的冲突很大程度上是关于教会在法国社会中的地位的意识形态冲突。特别是，教会被认为有责任否认中产阶级和农民的“启蒙”，这是法国大革命的承诺。因此，从某种意义上说，保守党的失败和共和党的优势标志着1789年开始的伟大运动的高潮(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:37)。教会和国家在法国的历史性联盟是建立在1801年教务专约的基础上的，一个是波拿巴担心天主教会反对“无神论”的共和国，一个是庇护七世渴望弥合“顽固的”和“宪法的”神职人员之间的分裂。双方都赢了。在他这边，教皇接受了罢免法国主教和惩戒支持革命的神职人员的权利，从而结束了革命前高卢教会的自治。从今以后，国家元首将提名主教，然后教皇将授予他们正式的机构。天主教礼拜的宣传，如在街上游行，再次被允许; 教会神学院被允许重新开放。

Bonaparte gained still more. By signing the Concordat, the pope virtually recognized the Republic. The Vatican agreed to raise no questions over former tithes and former church lands, the new owners of former church properties thus gaining clear titles. Religious toleration was preserved through Bonaparte's minimal, factual, and thus harmless admission that Roman Catholicism was the religion of “the great majority of French citizens”; and while the clergy were to be compensated for loss of tithes and properties by receiving a salary from the State, Bonaparte simultaneously dispelled the notion of an established church by placing Protestant ministers of all denominations on the payroll as well. To these provisos, Bonaparte unilaterally appended his “Organic Articles” — a code of ecclesiastical law whose Gallican objectives were to increase the authority of the bishop over the parish priest, that of the State over the bishop, and to limit the power of the pope over the French clergy (McManners 1972: 4; Dansette 1961, 129-37).

波拿巴得到的更多。通过签署协定，教皇实际上承认了共和国。梵蒂冈同意不对以前的什一税和以前的教会土地提出任何问题，以前教会财产的新所有者因此获得明确的所有权。宗教宽容通过波拿巴极少的，事实的，因此无害的承认罗马天主教是“绝大多数法国公民”的宗教而得以保留; 当神职人员因为失去什一税和财产而从国家领取薪水时，波拿巴同时通过把所有教派的新教牧师也列入工资单来消除一个已建立的教会的概念。在这些附加条款中，波拿巴单方面附加了他的“有机条款”——一部教会法典，其高卢人的目标是增加主教对教区牧师的权威，国家对主教的权威，并限制教皇对法国神职人员的权力(麦克曼纳斯1972:4; 丹赛特1961,129-37)。

During the First Empire and the regimes that followed, McManners observes, either side could have made the Concordat unworkable. The Vatican might have looked askance at changes of government, while French rulers might have asked in what sense the majority of citizens were Roman Catholics. But the Church believed in an alliance with the State on principle, and anticlericals were happy to see ecclesiastics bridled by specihc agreements. Both sides thus had an interest in making the settlement work, and by 1870, “custom and compromise under successive regimes had hlled the interstices of the original Concordat until the structure had acquired a venerable air, hallowed by time and seemingly irreplaceable” (McManners 1972: 5). To those who would eventually fill the ranks of the Opportunists, however, the Church seemed a growing and increasingly threatening presence. In the syllabus of 1864 which accompanied the encyclical Quanta Cura, Pius IX startled the modern world by condemning propositions which seemed self-evident to reasonable persons, including the suggestion that the Roman pontiff should reconcile himself to “progress, liberalism and modern civilization.” “In this enigmatical form,” commented the duc de Broglie, the pope seemed “to embrace in the same condemnation the press, railways, telegraphs, the discoveries of science” (McManners 1972: 19). And on July 18, 1870, the bishops assembled in St. Peter’s voted the constitution Pater aeternus, declaring the pope preserved from error when he speaks ex cathedra in matters of faith and morals. However ambiguous the Syllabus, and however limited the definition in Pater aeternus, McManners observes, in the eyes of other Christians as well as unbelievers, the Church “was irretrievably set on the path of absolutism in ecclesiastical government and, by analogy and from the experience of the present pontihcate, of reaction in matters social and political’’ (1972: 1).

麦克曼纳斯观察到，在第一帝国及其后的政权时期，任何一方都可能使协和飞机无法运转。梵蒂冈可能会对政府的更迭持怀疑态度，而法国统治者可能会问，大多数公民在什么意义上是罗马天主教徒。但是教会原则上相信与国家结盟，反神职人员乐于看到神职人员受到特定协议的约束。因此，双方都有兴趣解决这个问题，到1870年，“习惯和妥协在历代政权下已经填补了最初协约的空白，直到这个结构获得了一种庄严的气氛，被时间所神圣化，并且似乎不可替代”(麦克曼纳斯1972:5)。然而，对于那些最终填补机会主义者的行列，教会似乎是一个日益增长和日益威胁的存在。在1864年的教学大纲中，庇护九世通过谴责那些对于理性的人来说似乎是不言而喻的命题而震惊了现代世界，其中包括罗马教皇应该接受“进步、自由主义和现代文明”的建议德布罗意公爵评论道: “以这种神秘的形式，教皇似乎“同样谴责新闻、铁路、电报和科学发现”(麦克曼纳斯1972:19)。1870年7月18日，聚集在圣彼得大教堂的主教们投票通过了教皇永恒的宪法，宣布教皇在信仰和道德问题上的前教堂讲话不会犯错误。无论教学大纲多么模棱两可，无论帕特里克永恒的定义多么有限，麦克曼纳斯观察到，在其他基督徒和非信徒的眼中，教会“不可挽回地走上了教会政府中的专制主义道路，并且，通过类比和从现任教皇的经验来看，在社会和政治事务中的反应”(1972:1)。

Despite this reactionary posture, the Church enjoyed at least an ephemeral rise in popularity as a consequence of the Franco-Prussian War. The clergy had distinguished themselves as chaplains and orderlies, and some of the Catholic gentry as military officers. Bishops had defied the victorious Germans and denounced their demands for hostages, the Archbishop of Rheims demanding to be the first of the sureties they put on trains against the possibility of derailment. As the Commune decreed the separation of Church and State, confiscated ecclesiastical property, occupied church buildings and storehouses, and “executed” more than fifty priests as well as the Archbishop of Paris, the Church gained further respect and sympathy from respectable society. As the Empire collapsed and Paris made war on Versailles, all who had anything to lose embraced an institution long regarded as the last bastion of conservatism (McManners 1972: 32-3).

尽管采取了这种反动姿态，但由于普法战争，教会的受欢迎程度至少短暂上升。神职人员以牧师和勤务人员著称，一些天主教贵族则是军官。主教们公然反抗胜利的德国人，并谴责他们要求扣押人质，Rheims 大主教要求成为他们在火车上提供的第一批担保人，以防止出轨的可能性。随着公社颁布教会与国家关系，没收教会财产，占领教堂建筑和仓库，并“处决”了50多名牧师以及巴黎大主教，教会得到了尊敬和同情的社会进一步尊重和同情。随着帝国的瓦解，巴黎向凡尔赛开战，所有有可能失去的人都拥抱了一个长期以来被视为保守主义最后堡垒的机构(麦克曼纳斯1972:32-3)。

Was Catholicism still the religion of “the great majority of French citizens”? Official statistics of the 1870s suggest that it was, listing 35,000,000 people as Catholics, in contrast to 600,000 Protestants, 50,000 Jews, and only 80,000 “free-thinkers” (McManners 1972: 5). There was a diocese corresponding to almost every department, and 36,000 parishes, an average of one to every thousand inhabitants. Each had its cure or desservant (priest in charge), and some had vicaires or other assistant clergy - a total of 51,000 priests engaged in the parochial ministry. These were supported by 4,000 other secular priests who were canons, directors of seminaries, or schoolmasters. The supervision of religion was, in terms of the numbers of people dependent upon it, one of the principal civil ministries. The annual budget for religion exceeded 50 million francs (McManners 1972: 20, 78). Although the Concordat had not provided for the return of the religious congregations, they had in fact returned in force, including traditional orders like the Trappists, Benedictines, and Dominicans, and a variety of new organizations reflecting the idiosyncrasies of local environments. Male congregations - only 5 of which enjoyed state authorization - had increased from 59 (in 1856) to 116 (embracing 30,000 members) by 1877. Among them were the 60 houses and 2,000 members of the Society of Jesus, active again as schoolmasters despite a Restoration decree prohibiting them from teaching. In their 29 colleges, the Jesuits taught 11,000 pupils, approximately one-fourth of all pupils in colleges run by religious orders. Congregations of women, enjoying authorization under a law of 1825, multiplied even earlier and more rapidly. By 1875 there were more than 127,000 nuns, or one to every 280 members of the population — 3 times more than on the eve of the Revolution (McManners 1972: 20—1; Bury 1985: 157; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 78). In addition to the sheer numbers of Catholics and the strength of their clergy, a variety of social services seem to have been almost entirely in Church hands. In 1880, for example, the hospitals and hospices run by the religious orders dealt with 114,199 persons in need of assistance. More than 60,000 children were received in Catholic orphanages and workrooms; and to these must be added the Catholic apprenticeship schools, Church clubs, rest homes, and lunatic asylums (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 79). But it was in education that the power of the Roman Catholic Church in France seemed to be at its height.

天主教仍然是“绝大多数法国公民”的宗教吗？19世纪70年代的官方统计数据显示，有3500万人是天主教徒，相比之下，60万新教徒，5万犹太人，只有8万“自由思想者”(McManners 1972:5)。几乎每个省都有一个教区，有36,000个教区，平均每一千个居民就有一个教区。每个教会都有自己的治疗方法或者配料(主管牧师) ，有些教会还有代理人或者其他助理牧师——总共有51000名牧师从事教区事工。他们得到了其他4000名世俗牧师的支持，这些牧师都是教士、神学院院长或校长。对宗教的监督，就依赖宗教的人数而言，是主要的文职部门之一。每年的宗教预算超过5000万法郎(麦克曼纳斯1972年: 20,78)。虽然《协定》没有规定宗教会众的回归，但实际上他们已经有效地回归了，包括特拉普派、本笃会和多明我会等传统教派，以及各种反映当地环境特点的新组织。男性会众——其中只有5个享有国家授权——从1856年的59个增加到1877年的116个(拥有30,000名会员)。其中包括60个家庭和2,000名耶稣会成员，尽管恢复法令禁止他们教学，他们仍然作为校长活跃起来。在他们的29所大学中，耶稣会教授了11,000名学生，大约占宗教团体管理的大学学生总数的四分之一。根据1825年的一项法律享有授权的妇女集会数量增加得更快更早。到1875年，全国有超过12.7万名修女，相当于每280名人口中就有一名修女，是大革命前夕的3倍(麦克曼纳斯1972:20ー1; 伯里1985:157; 梅耶尔和雷贝里乌1984:78)。除了天主教徒的绝对数量和他们的神职人员的力量，各种各样的社会服务似乎已经几乎完全掌握在教会手中。例如，在1880年，由宗教团体经营的医院和收容所处理了114,199名需要帮助的人。超过60,000名儿童被安置在天主教孤儿院和工作室; 除此之外，还有天主教学徒学校、教会俱乐部、养老院和精神病院(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:79)。但正是在教育领域，罗马天主教会在法国的权力似乎达到了顶峰。

In spite of the anticlericalism which survived the First Empire and continued into the 1830s and 1840s, the Church had repeatedly tried to improve its position by undermining the university monopoly of higher and secondary education. Its struggle, eloquently served by the new school of Liberal Catholics led by the Comte de Montalem-bert, was rewarded in 1850 by the Loi Falloux - a gesture of domestic politics by Louis Napoleon to French Catholics which would secure the position of Catholics in education for the next thirty years. The State monopoly was broken. Henceforth, there were be two categories of school: the public schools founded and maintained by communes, departments, or the State; and the already flourishing free schools founded by private individuals or associations. In effect, this meant that any authorized or tolerated religious association could open a school, and be subject only to the most nominal State inspection. Until the Second Empire stopped the practice, local authorities could hand over their own schools to the charge of religious orders; and since monks and nuns required no salaries, frugality repeatedly overwhelmed anticlericalism in the deliberations of rural councillors. The religious orders - and particularly the Jesuits — came to play an increasingly important part in education (Bury 1985: 81—2; McManners 1972: 21). By 1870, almost 40 percent of the nation’s children were educated in Church schools.[3](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark14) The sons of the aristocracy, magistrates, and army officers were consistently sent to the colleges of the orders — particularly those of the Jesuits, who specialized in training young men for the Polytechnique and the naval and military academies. The education of women came even further under the influence of the Church. Three-fifths of all girls were taught by the sisters of the congregations, and even in anticlerical areas, there was a widespread belief that nuns should be in charge of feminine education. When an attempt was made under the Second Empire to establish State secondary schools for girls, Mgr. Dupanloup protested that many of the teachers would be men, some irreligious, and some even youthful. The project collapsed when clerical journals published the names of the girls attending (McManners 1972: 21-2). As late as 1930, Andre Siegfried could still observe that there was no type of Frenchman more typical than the anticlerical deputy whose wife was a devout Catholic and whose daughters were educated in a convent (Bury 1985: 159).

尽管第一帝国时期的反教权主义一直延续到19世纪30年代和40年代，但教会一再试图通过破坏大学对高等和中等教育的垄断来改善自己的地位。它的斗争，雄辩地服务于蒙塔勒姆伯爵领导的新自由天主教学校，在1850年得到了法卢的回报——这是路易 · 拿破仑对法国天主教徒的一种国内政治姿态，将确保天主教在未来三十年的教育地位。国家垄断被打破了。从此以后，学校分为两类: 由公社、部门或国家建立和维持的公立学校; 以及由私人或协会建立的业已繁荣的免费学校。实际上，这意味着任何经过授权或容忍的宗教团体都可以开办学校，只接受最象征性的国家检查。在第二帝国停止这种做法之前，地方当局可以把自己的学校交给宗教团体负责; 由于僧侣和尼姑不需要工资，在农村议员的审议中，节俭一再压倒了反教权主义。宗教秩序，尤其是耶稣会，在教育中扮演着越来越重要的角色(伯里1985:81ー2; 麦克曼纳斯1972:21)。到1870年，全国近40% 的儿童在教会学校接受教育。3贵族、治安官和军官的儿子一直被送往教会学院，尤其是那些耶稣会士的学院，他们专门为理工学院、海军和军事学院培训年轻人。在教会的影响下，妇女的教育进一步发展。五分之三的女孩由教会的修女教授，甚至在反教会地区，人们普遍认为修女应该负责女性教育。当第二帝国试图建立女子公立中学时，Mgr。杜潘卢普抗议说，许多老师都是男性，有些不信教，有些甚至很年轻。当文书刊物刊登出席的女孩的名字时，这个项目失败了(麦克曼纳斯1972:21-2)。直到1930年，安德烈 · 西格弗里德(Andre Siegfried)仍然可以观察到，没有任何一种法国人比反教士的副手更典型，他的妻子是虔诚的天主教徒，他的女儿在修道院接受教育(伯里1985:159)。

In higher education, a law of July 12, 1875 was to increase the Church’s influence still more. It allowed the opening of “free institutes of higher education’’ — in short, Catholic universities — and allotted the award of degrees to mixed boards of examiners consisting of professors from State faculties and from their Catholic counterparts. Instantly such universities appeared at Paris, Lille, Lyon, Angers, and Toulouse, and with substantial means at their disposal, they soon attracted first-rate faculties and competed effectively with the State universities. Bishops continued to sit on the Conseil Superieur, while priests sat on the academic boards. Religious instruction, given by chaplains, formed part of the timetables of lycees (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 79). “Au point de vue sociologique,” Durkheim would say in 1905, “l’Eglise est un monstre’’ (1905: 369). If so, in 1870 it was a very large monstre indeed, and one that threatened to grow still larger.

在高等教育领域，1875年7月12日的一项法律进一步扩大了教会的影响力。它允许开设“免费高等教育学院”(简称天主教大学) ，并将学位授予由国立学院教授和天主教教授组成的混合考试委员会。这样的大学立即出现在巴黎、里尔、里昂、昂热和图卢兹，他们拥有可支配的实质性资源，很快就吸引了一流的教师，并与国立大学展开了有效的竞争。主教继续担任高级议会议员，而牧师则担任学术委员会委员。由牧师授课的宗教教导，构成了中学生课程表的一部分(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:79)。“从社会学的角度来看,”涂尔干在1905年说，“教会是一个怪物”(1905:369)。如果是这样的话，那么在1870年，它确实是一个非常巨大的怪物，而且还有可能变得更大。

Not surprisingly, the 1870s and 1880s became a period of renascent Catholic spirituality[4](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark15) and mass pilgrimages, the latter inspired in part by the desire to offer reparation for sins reputed to have brought on the Prussian defeat and the horrors of the Commune. The chief resort for such journeys was the shrine of Paray-le-Monial, where the faithful made “the consecration of a penitent France to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.’’ The Augustins de L’Assomption, a brotherhood founded in mid-century, set the pattern by negotiating cheap railway fares, printing song sheets, and publishing a newspaper, Le P'elerin (McManners 1972: 22). Revelations, prophecies, and miracles multiplied. Yet despite its popularity after the War and the Commune, its 35,000,000 followers, the strength of its clergy, its control of social services, its power over French education, and its renascent spirituality, the Catholic Church in France was a deeply troubled institution.

不足为奇的是，19世纪70年代和80年代成为了天主教精神复兴和大规模朝圣的时期，后者的部分灵感来自于对造成普鲁士战败和公社恐怖的罪恶进行补偿的愿望。此类旅行的主要胜地是帕赖勒莫尼亚勒圣地，信徒们在那里“将忏悔的法国献给耶稣的圣心”成立于上世纪中叶的奥古斯丁兄弟会(The Augustins de L’Assomtion) ，通过协商低廉的铁路票价、印刷歌曲单和出版报纸 Le P’elerin (McManners 1972:22) ，确立了这种模式。启示、预言和奇迹成倍增加。然而，尽管它在战后和公社之后很受欢迎，它有3500万信徒，它的神职人员的力量，它对社会服务的控制，它对法国教育的权力，以及它复兴的精神，法国的天主教会是一个深受困扰的机构。

Some of these troubles were internal, others derived from the social and economic changes of late 19th-century France, and still others could be attributed to the increasingly zealous activities of non-Catholic or anti-Catholic groups. But whatever the causes, they were suf®cient to render the Church extremely vulnerable to the attacks of anticlericals like Durkheim after 1879. Not least among the Church's internal dif®culties, for example, was its lack of a central organization or a distinctive French voice. Nothing had replaced the Assembly General of the Clergy of the ancien regime, the Concordat had been negotiated by the Pope alone, and after 1811, there had been no more plenary meetings of the French episcopate. If the Church of France was to speak as a unity, therefore, the lead would have to come from the Vatican, where Pius IX, having lost the protection of French troops to the Franco-Prussian disaster, had declared himself a “prisoner” of the new kingdom of Italy. The history of the French Church in the 1870s and 1880s, therefore, was one punctuated with ultramontanist calls — most of which fell upon deaf republican ears — for the “liberation” of the Pope. A second difficulty was that French clergy themselves were divided in their degree of ultramontanist zeal. McManners notes that, by 1870, the social gulf between the lower clergy and the French episcopate had largely evaporated, but that a cultural and intellectual gulf had endured. The parish clergy came consistently from the less-educated classes, while the bishops typically possessed literary and classical educations, and were utter strangers to the parochial ministry.[5](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark16) Enjoying a salary 20 times that of a cure, a bishop inevitably appeared to those below as an aloof, superior figure. By contrast, only one secular priest in ten enjoyed security of tenure; the others could be moved by the bishop at will and, if accused of offences, disciplined without due process (1972: 25).

其中一些麻烦来自国内，另一些则源于19世纪末法国的社会和经济变革，还有一些麻烦可以归因于非天主教或反天主教团体日益狂热的活动。但无论原因是什么，它们都足以使教会在1879年之后极易受到涂尔干等反教权主义者的攻击。举例来说，教会内部缺乏一个中央组织或者一个独特的法国声音，这不仅仅是教会的内部缺陷。没有什么能够取代旧政权的神职人员大会，协定只是由教皇单独谈判达成的，1811年以后，法国主教再也没有举行过全体会议。因此，如果法兰西教会要作为一个整体发言，那么领导者就必须来自梵蒂冈。在那里，庇护九世在普法灾难中失去了法国军队的保护，宣布自己是意大利新王国的“囚徒”。因此，在19世纪70年代和80年代的法国教会历史上，不时有人呼吁“解放”教皇，其中大部分呼吁都落入了对此充耳不闻的共和党人的耳中。第二个困难是，法国神职人员自己在超蒙特热情程度上也存在分歧。麦克曼纳斯指出，到1870年，下层神职人员和法国主教之间的社会鸿沟已基本消失，但文化和知识分子之间的鸿沟仍然存在。教区的神职人员一直来自受教育程度较低的阶层，而主教们通常都受过文学和古典教育，对于教区的事工完全陌生。5. 主教的薪水是医生的20倍，在下面的人看来，他不可避免地是一个高高在上的人物。相比之下，只有十分之一的世俗牧师享有任期保障; 其他人可以由主教随意调动，如果被指控犯罪，没有正当程序的处罚(1972:25)。

Under these circumstances, one can see why that “ghostly Gallicanism which lingered on in the episcopal palaces after 1870” had largely disappeared from the presbyteries. In fact, under Pius IX the Roman Curia consistently lent a sympathetic ear to the complaints of French parish priests, who were further encouraged by Louis Veuillot’s L'Univers, the principal Catholic newspaper. Widely read in rural districts, L'Univers denounced Gallicanism and Liberal Catholicism alike, while simultaneously demanding allegiance to the Chair of Peter, and rendered compromise with even a moderate republicanism unthinkable (McManners 1972: 23). While it is difficult to imagine that a country with a priest for every 639 inhabitants might lack an effective parochial ministry, this was the principal thesis of the abbe Bougaud’s Le grand peril de l'Eglise de France (1878), which noted the decline in annual ordinations from 1,753 (in 1868) to 1,582 (in 1877). The aristocracy and bourgeoisie were still interested in the religious orders for their daughters; but 9 out of 10 candidates for the ministry came from the families of peasants and artisans. With his 850 francs, McManners observes, a desservant earned the wage of a gendarme; a vicaire received less than half as much; and even a cure, of whom there were only 5,600, could rise only to 1,500 (1972: 27). Respect for apostolic poverty notwithstanding, the ministry was a low-status occupation.

在这种情况下，我们可以看出为什么“1870年以后徘徊在主教宫殿里的幽灵般的高卢主义”已经在长老会中基本上消失了。事实上，在庇护九世时期，罗马教廷始终对法国教区牧师的抱怨给予同情的倾听，而这些法国教区牧师又受到路易斯 · 维耶洛(Louis Veuillot)的主要天主教报纸《世界报》(L’Univers)的进一步鼓励。在乡村地区广为流传的《环球报》谴责高卢主义和自由主义天主教，同时要求效忠彼得主席，并对温和的共和主义做出了难以想象的妥协(麦克曼纳斯1972:23)。虽然很难想象一个每639名居民就有一名牧师的国家会缺乏一个有效的教区事工，但这是布高神父(Abbe Bougaud)在《法兰西教堂的大危险》(Le grand peril de l’Eglise de France，1878)中的主要论点，该书指出，每年的神职从1753人(1868年)减少到1582人(1877年)。贵族和资产阶级仍然对他们女儿的宗教秩序感兴趣，但是十个候选人中有九个来自农民和工匠家庭。麦克曼纳斯注意到，用他的850法郎，一个甜点工人挣的工资相当于一个宪兵; 一个牧师挣的不到一半; 甚至一个只有5600法郎的治愈方法，也只能增加到1500法郎(1972:27)。尽管尊重使徒的贫穷，但事工是一个地位低下的职业。

As the intellectual foundations of Christian belief came under increasing attack from Biblical criticism, natural science, and the comparative study of religion, it is understandable that a ministry thus recruited would be found wanting; and to compound the problem, the educational program of the seminaries was limited to meditation, pious exercises, and the rehearsal of antiquated dogma: “In ancient manuals written in dog latin,’’ McManners observes, “seminarists studied theological courses consisting of fragments of the Scriptures, the Fathers, and the Councils tacked together. The chronological dif®culties of Genesis were still explained by the theory of ‘jour-epoques,’ the millennial ‘days’ of creation, and the implausibility of the Flood story was overcome by con®ning it to a segment of the earth’s surface’’ (1972: 27—8). McManners finds only two diocesan prelates who, in the 1870s and 1880s, had any firsthand knowledge of the new German biblical criticism that had already inspired Robertson Smith and, largely through Smith, would influence Durkheim; and McManners adds that even Mgr. Du-panloup, the great Liberal Catholic, was helpless in the face of Renan’s Vie de Jesus (1863).

由于基督教信仰的知识基础受到圣经批判、自然科学和宗教比较研究的越来越多的攻击，可以理解的是，这样招募的神职人员会被发现不足，并且使问题更加复杂化，神学院的教育计划仅限于冥想、虔诚的练习和排练过时的教条: “在用狗拉丁文写的古代手册中,”麦克曼纳斯观察到，“神学院学生学习的神学课程由圣经的片段、父亲和理事会拼凑在一起。创世纪的年代差异仍然可以用“时代”理论来解释，即创世纪的千年“日子”，而洪水故事的不可思议性被骗到了地球表面的一部分而被克服。麦克曼纳斯发现，在19世纪70年代和80年代，只有两位主教教区的主教有关于德国新圣经批判的第一手知识，这些知识已经启发了罗伯逊•史密斯，并且主要通过史密斯影响了涂尔干。伟大的自由主义天主教徒杜潘卢普在雷南的《耶稣的生活》(1863)面前无能为力。

Even the figure of 35,000,000 French Catholics seems dubious. Many of these, McManners insists, “accepted no obligation beyond making their Easter communion, many merely attended mass occasionally, or came to church to be married or were brought there to be buried, many were nominal Catholics whose allegiance did not extend beyond the census forms” (1972: 5). A more certain guide, he adds, are the statistics of voting in national elections. In every instance, when the country had a chance to pronounce on the anticlerical policies of the 1870s and 1880s, it endorsed them. “True,” he admits, “the issue was never clear-cut; even so, the voting could not have consistently gone this way unless there had been large numbers of ‘Catholics’ of various kinds who refused to put institutional loyalty before what they regarded as the best overall decision for the political administration of the country.’’ Catholicism, it seems, was not unmixed with an anticlericalism of its own. Clemenceau could thus refer to a France “qui a des habitudes cultuelles, mais qui a en horreur le gouvernement des cures’’ (McManners 1972: 11).

甚至连3500万法国天主教徒的数字也令人怀疑。麦克曼纳坚持认为，其中许多人“除了参加复活节圣餐外没有接受任何义务，许多人只是偶尔参加弥撒，或者来教堂结婚，或者被带到那里埋葬，许多人是名义上的天主教徒，他们的忠诚并没有超出人口普查表格的范围”(1972:5)。他补充说，一个更确定的指南是全国选举中的投票统计数据。在任何情况下，当国家有机会对19世纪70年代和80年代的反教权政策发表意见时，它都支持这些政策。“的确,”他承认，“这个问题从来就不明确; 即便如此，投票也不可能一直如此，除非有大量各种各样的‘天主教徒’拒绝把对制度的忠诚置于他们认为对国家政治管理最好的总体决策之上。”看来，天主教并不是与自己的反教权主义完全混杂在一起的。因此，克莱门梭可以把法国称为“一个有文化习惯，但令治疗政府感到恐惧的国家”(麦克曼纳斯1972:11)。

Quite aside from its internal difficulties, the Church faced serious problems adapting to the social and economic transformation of France in the late 19th century. The population of the diocese of Paris, for example, rose from 1,953,000 (in 1861) to 2,411,000 (in 1877) to 3,849,000 (in 1906); and as the conditions of the Concordat made it dif®cult to endow new parishes, and the government made no provision for moving priests from old ones, the traditional parochial system foundered.[6](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark17) Similar problems afflicted Marseilles, Lille, Saint-Etienne, and Lyon. In Le Present et 1'avenir du Catholicisme (1892), the duc de Broglie thus argued that the Church was being defeated not so much by skepticism as by administrative breakdown under the sheer weight of numbers. To this, one must add the indifferent knowledge of an urban, working-class world possessed by a clergy of rural origins, whose language, values, and morals were largely those of an earlier age. The traditional palliative of alms-giving, widely endorsed and practiced, was ill-®tted to cope with urban discontent and misery. In Lille where, under the Second Empire, 30 percent of the deaths were from consumption and diseases of the lungs, rickets and syphilitic debility, the Catholic “Society for Good Books’’ distributed Mme de Gaulle’s Georges: ou le bon usage des richesses. The presence of the Church at ceremonial functions was undermined, a sharp fall in the number of baptisms and a rise in the number of civil marriages and burials occurring after 1875. The city, Mayeur and Reberioux emphasize, “a modern Babylon which the Church distrusted, was the citadel of religious indifference” (1984: 104), and comparisons of the new districts in Paris with “heathen lands afar’’ were not uncommon (McManners 1972: 30, 7).

除了国内的困难，教会在适应19世纪末法国的社会和经济变革方面也面临着严重的问题。例如，巴黎教区的人口从1861年的1953,000人增加到1877年的2411,000人，到1906年的3849,000人; 由于《协约》的条款使得新的教区很难建立起来，而且政府也没有规定从旧的教区迁移牧师，传统的教区制度就失败了。类似的问题困扰着马赛、里尔、圣艾蒂安和里昂。在《现在与未来的天主教》(1892)一书中，德布罗意公爵因此认为，教会的失败与其说是因为怀疑主义，不如说是因为纯粹的人数压力导致的行政崩溃。除此之外，我们还必须加上对城市工人阶级世界的漠不关心的认识，这个世界是由一个农村出身的神职人员所拥有的，他们的语言、价值观和道德观大部分都是早期的。传统的施舍缓和政策得到了广泛的认可和实践，但在应对城市的不满和苦难方面却显得不那么有效。在里尔，在第二帝国统治下，30% 的死亡是由肺病、佝偻病和梅毒引起的，天主教“好书协会”分发戴高乐夫人的《乔治: 财富的优越使用》。1875年以后，教会参加宗教仪式的人数减少，洗礼的数量急剧下降，公证结婚和葬礼的数量增加。这座城市，Mayeur 和雷贝里乌强调，“一个教会不信任的现代巴比伦，是宗教冷漠的堡垒”(1984:104) ，将巴黎的新区与“远方的异教徒土地”相比较并不罕见(麦克曼纳斯1972:30,7)。

The Church was no more able to appeal to the middle classes. The old, “Voltairean” bourgeoisie of the provinces had largely been reconciled to a vague kind of faith; but Gambetta’s “new strata’’ was utterly indifferent if not hostile. The growth of ultramontanism among French Catholics, their loyalty to a Pope who had promulgated the Syllabus and the Decree of Infallibility, their campaigns for the defense of the Temporal power before 1870 and its restoration thereafter, and their unconcealed support for Royalists and opposition to the Republic led this new bourgeoisie, whose rise was intimately bound to the values of science, education, and progress, to see in the Church a force of reaction and obscurantism (Bury 1985: 157). Even the religious faith of the aristocracy, reputedly rediscovered in the Revolution, might be questioned: “Catholicism,” as Anatole France dryly observed, was “still the most acceptable form of religious indifference” (McManners 1972: 10).

教会再也不能吸引中产阶级了。旧的、“伏尔泰式”的省级资产阶级大多已经接受了一种模糊的信仰; 但甘贝塔的“新阶层”即使不是敌对的，也是完全无动于衷的。法国天主教徒中超蒙特主义的增长，他们对颁布了教学大纲和不可错过法令的教皇的忠诚，他们在1870年之前捍卫世俗权力的运动及其后的恢复，以及他们对保皇党的公开支持和对共和国的反对，导致了这个新的资产阶级，其崛起与科学、教育和进步的价值观密切相关，在教会中看到了一股反动力量和蒙昧主义(Bury 1985:157)。甚至贵族的宗教信仰，据说在大革命中被重新发现，也可能受到质疑: “天主教”，正如阿纳托尔 · 法兰西冷冷地评论，“仍然是最可接受的形式的宗教冷漠”(麦克曼纳斯1972:10)。

To these difficulties of the Church must be added the much wider breadth of opinion to which the French population would be exposed. Thanks to the invention of the rotary press, post-free railway distribution, and the mass appeal of advertising, the penny newspaper, which accounted for almost half the papers printed in 1870 and three-quarters by 1880, easily reached the countryside (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 116). To this were added the local weekly or bi-weekly newspapers, and the illustrated magazines and catalogues from major Parisian stores. Quite aside from manifestly anticlerical publications like Guerolt’s L'Opinion nationale, these carriers of a new, popular, Parisian culture, together with military service and improvements in transportation, broadened the horizons of the French people and undermined local, traditional values (Bury 1985: 157; McManners 1972: 14; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 117). Similarly, to the middle-class resentment of priestly intervention in the life of the family, the popular writer added “a frisson of sensibility” (McManners 1972: 15). From George Sand’s Lelia (1833) and Marguerite Gautier’s La Morte amoureuse (1836—7) to Anatole France’s Thais (1890), the theme of the futility of asceticism and its betrayal of the most valued human emotions was repeatedly explored. The positivism of Gambetta’s “new strata’’ was satished by the determinism of the Goncourts, de Maupassant, and especially Zola, whose Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le second Empire began to appear in 1871. Led by the “Parnassians” C.-M.-R. Leconte de Lisle, R.-F.-A. Sully-Prudhomme, and Francoise Coppee, poetry conformed just as easily to the ideology of faith in science and progress (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 120—1).

除了教会的这些困难之外，还必须加上更广泛的意见，使法国人民能够接触到这些意见。由于旋转印刷机的发明，铁路免费发行，以及广告的大众吸引力，便士报纸，在1870年几乎占了报纸印刷量的一半，到1880年占了四分之三，很容易到达农村(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:116)。除此之外，还增加了当地的周报或双周报，以及来自巴黎主要商店的插图杂志和目录。除了像 Guerolt 的《国家意见》这样明显反教会的出版物，这些新的、流行的、巴黎文化的载体，加上军事服务和交通的改善，拓宽了法国人民的视野，破坏了当地的传统价值观(Bury 1985:157; McManners 1972:14; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:117)。同样，对于中产阶级对于神父干预家庭生活的不满，这位通俗作家补充道: “一种情感的颤栗”(McManners 1972:15)。从乔治 · 桑的《莉莉亚》(1833)和玛格丽特 · 戈蒂埃的《死亡之恋》(1836ー7)到 Anatole France 的《泰国人》(1890) ，禁欲主义的无用性及其对人类最宝贵情感的背叛这一主题被反复探讨。甘贝塔的“新阶层”的实证主义被贡古尔特、莫泊桑、尤其是左拉的决定论所满足。左拉的《第二帝国下的自然与社会家庭的历史》于1871年开始出版。领头的是“帕纳西亚人”C.-M。勒贡特·德·列尔。萨利-普鲁多姆和弗朗索瓦丝 · 科比，诗歌同样轻易地符合对科学和进步的信仰的意识形态(迈耶和雷贝里奥1984:120ー1)。

Recognizing these difficulties afflicting the Church, it is worth recalling that the Roman Catholic was not the only religious confession in late 19th-century France. There were 580,000 Protestants in France in 1872, and their economic standing and intellectual significance far transcended their numbers (Bury 1985: 156). After the synod of 1872, a division in the Reformed Church produced a liberal Protestant minority which practiced ecclesiastical democracy, rejected theological dogma, reduced religion to a rational morality, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and thus became another component of the secular, republican idea. Protestants like Ferdinand Buisson (whom Durkheim replaced at the Sorbonne in 1902), Felix Pecaut, J. Steeg, and Elie Rabier played important roles in Ferry’s educational reforms, and the neo-Kantian philosopher Charles Renouvier (1815—1903), whom Durkheim called “mon educateur,’’ called on republicans to become Protestants (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 107—8).

认识到这些困难折磨着教会，值得一提的是，罗马天主教并不是19世纪末法国唯一的宗教忏悔。1872年，法国有58万新教徒，他们的经济地位和知识分子的重要性远远超过他们的人数(伯里1985:156)。在1872年的宗教大会之后，改革教会的一个分支产生了一个自由的新教少数派，他们实行教会民主，拒绝神学教条，将宗教降格为一种理性的道德，鼓励探索自由，因此成为世俗的，共和主义思想的另一个组成部分。新教徒如费迪南·比松(涂尔干于1902年在 Sorbonne 取代了他)、菲利克斯 · 皮考特、 J · 斯蒂格和埃利 · 拉比尔在费里的教育改革中发挥了重要作用，新康德派哲学家查尔斯 · 雷诺维耶(1815ー1903) ，被涂尔干称为“我的教育家”，呼吁共和党人成为新教徒(梅耶和雷贝里乌1984:107ー8)。

The Jewish minority comprised 50,000 by 1870, most of them living in Paris (McManners 1972: 5). While those who had recently immigrated from Eastern Europe remained isolated by their language (Yiddish) and retained their religious traditions, Alsatian Jews like Durkheim were largely assimilated. Granted citizenship and the right to vote in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790), these assimilated Jews remained attached to the tradition of the Revolution, and consistently supported the progressive, secular Republic. The “tens of thousands’’ of freemasons (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 109), whose numbers doubled between 1862 and 1889, were also ardently republican (Bury 1985: 157). The largely middle-class lodges became centers of anticlerical feeling where republican politicians could discuss the strategies of “laicization” more conveniently than in cafes or at private dinner parties (McManners 1972: 18). Finally, Bury insists that the majority of the brilliant young men trained at the Ecole Normale Superieure after 1848, as well as the majority of those republican leaders who were not Protestants, were simply agnostics, for whom “the cult of the Great Revolution had become almost a religion, and, in so far as it affected their political thinking, intensihed the political offensive of the Left against the Church” (1985: 156). McManners estimates that there were 80,000 “free-thinkers” in France in the 1870s (1972: 5).

到1870年，犹太少数民族人口已达5万，其中大多数居住在巴黎(麦克曼纳斯1972:5)。虽然那些最近从东欧移民过来的人仍然因为他们的语言(意第绪语)而被孤立，并且保留了他们的宗教传统，但是像迪尔凯姆这样的阿尔萨斯犹太人在很大程度上被同化了。被赋予公民权和在教士的公民组织法(1790年)投票的权利，这些被同化的犹太人仍然坚持革命的传统，并一贯支持进步的，世俗的共和国。“成千上万”的共济会员(Mayeur 和 Reberioux 1984:109) ，他们的数量在1862年到1889年间翻了一番，也是热情的共和党人(Bury 1985:157)。大部分中产阶级的小屋成为反教会情绪的中心，在这里，共和党政治家可以比在咖啡馆或私人晚宴上更方便地讨论“合法化”的策略(麦克曼纳斯1972:18)。最后，伯里坚持认为，1848年后在高等师范学校受训的绝大多数聪明的年轻人，以及绝大多数非新教徒的共和党领导人，都是不可知论者，对他们来说，“对大革命的崇拜几乎已经成为一种宗教，而且，就其影响他们的政治思想而言，加剧了左派对教会的政治攻势”(1985:156)。麦克曼纳斯估计，在19世纪70年代，法国有8万名“自由思想者”(1972:5)。

Both internal and external difficulties of the Church, therefore, conspired to make anticlericalism an established feature of French life by 1870. Anticlericalism, of course, may be traced back to the literate sensibilities of the Enlightenment, the jest books of the Renaissance, and even the sullen resentments of the Middle Ages. McManners goes so far as to suggest that it might be an instinctive reaction to the presence of any organized, authoritative priesthood. The priest is there to be loved or hated, not to seek that quiet social acceptance which is the goal of most ordinary citizens. The confessional and its place in the lives of women had always aroused resentment and, quite aside from the occasional incidents of clerical immorality seized upon by Guerolt’s L'Opinion nationale, there was a widely held view that celibacy and especially monasticism represented dehance of the fundamental virtues of the bourgeois family. “Parents” McManners observes, “were entitled to enjoy their children’s company: when his daughter entered a convent, the baron de Ponnet wrote to his friends on black-edged notepaper. Men without children of their own, without a stake in the country and uncommitted to society ought not to direct the consciences of women and the minds of schoolboys” (1972: 14-15).

因此，到1870年，教会的内部和外部困难共同促使反教权主义成为法国生活的一个既定特征。当然，反教权主义可以追溯到启蒙运动时期的文学敏感性，文艺复兴时期的笑话书，甚至中世纪的阴郁怨恨。麦克曼纳斯甚至认为，这可能是对任何有组织、有权威的神职人员出现的本能反应。神父的存在是为了被爱或者被恨，而不是为了寻求那种平静的社会认可，那是大多数普通公民的目标。忏悔及其在女性生活中的地位总是引起不满，除了格罗特的《全国意见》偶尔抓住的牧师不道德的事件之外，还有一种普遍的观点认为，独身主义，尤其是修道主义，代表了资产阶级家庭的基本美德的亵渎。“父母”麦克曼纳斯注意到，“有权享受他们的孩子的陪伴: 当他的女儿进入修道院，男爵德庞奈写信给他的朋友在黑边的信纸。男人没有自己的孩子，在国家没有利害关系，对社会没有承诺，不应该指导妇女的良心和男学生的思想”(1972:14-15)。

But the 19th century brought new fuel to this slowly burning hre. After his conversion to anticlericalism, for example, the works of the great romantic historian Jules Michelet increasingly emphasized the abuses of the confessional, the political maneuvers of the Jesuits, the Gallican tradition of opposition to Roman encroachments, the sufferings of French Protestants, and the glory of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. To those for whom the Revolution meant ancestral lands freed from the tithe and the acquisition of ecclesiastical properties, Michelet’s writings - incongruously related to memories of the Napoleonic domination of Europe - became “a patriotic Bible whose contents resembled a bloodstained and triumphant Old Testament story . . . Against the Catholic myth of a Christian France,” McManners observes, “had arisen the counter-myth of a revolutionary France, the standardbearer of liberty” (1972: 15-16).

但是19世纪给这个缓慢燃烧的地方带来了新的燃料。例如，在他转向反教权主义之后，伟大的浪漫主义历史学家朱尔斯 · 米切莱特(Jules Michelet)的著作越来越强调宗教信仰的滥用、耶稣会士的政治策略、反对罗马侵略的高卢传统、法国新教徒的痛苦，以及《人权和公民权利宣言》(Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen)的荣耀。对于那些认为革命意味着祖传土地从什一税中解放出来并获得教会财产的人来说，米切莱特的著作——与拿破仑统治欧洲的记忆不协调地联系在一起——变成了“一本爱国的圣经，其内容类似于一个血迹斑斑的胜利的旧约故事... ... 反对基督教法国的天主教神话,”麦克曼纳斯评论道，“出现了一个革命法国的反神话，一个自由的旗手”(1972:15-16)。

“Scientihc” historical scholarship was still more devastating when applied to the sacred texts themselves. Between 1858 and 1865 the Revue germanique published the latest results of German biblical scholarship, introducing doubts about Christology and chronology, miracles, prophecies, the sequence of particular documents, and the very authenticity of certain texts. Much of this could be dismissed as obscure, recondite, and therefore trivial; but in 1862, Ernest Renan — who had attended Catholic seminaries and even taken minor orders before abandoning the faith - used his inaugural lecture as professor of Hebrew at the College de France to deny the divinity of Jesus Christ. One year later Renan published his Vie de Jesus, which combined erudition and literary skill to an unprecedented effect, explaining the Resurrection as a mere rumor propagated by Christ’s followers and eliminating supernatural elements from the Gospels altogether. More than 60,000 copies of La Vie de Jesus were sold within the ®rst year of publication (Renan 1991: vii; McManners 1972: 16). The discoveries of natural science were no less important. In 1862, for example, a French translation of Darwin’s Origin of Species was published with a preface denying the Christian doctrine of creation; and after the Franco-Prussian War, the widely recognized superiority of German science and secular education was cited by Renan as a cause of the disasters at Sedan. Henceforth, promising young agreegees like Durkheim would be sent to Germany to study, and they would return, also like Durkheim, committed to the overthrow of the elitist, humanist, and largely Catholic-supported system of French education. Anticlericalism was thus bound up, not just with positivism and empiricism, but with both domestic and international politics as well.

“科学”历史学术在应用于圣典本身时更具破坏性。1858年至1865年间，德国讽刺文学杂志发表了德国圣经学术的最新成果，介绍了对基督论和年代学的怀疑，奇迹，预言，特定文献的顺序，以及某些文本的真实性。其中大部分可能被认为晦涩难懂，因此微不足道; 但在1862年，欧内斯特 · 雷南(Ernest Renan)——他曾在天主教神学院就读，甚至在放弃信仰之前接受过次要的命令——利用他作为法兰西学院(College de France)希伯来语教授的就职演讲否定了耶稣基督的神性。一年后，雷南出版了他的《耶稣的生命》(Vie de Jesus) ，这本书将博学和文学技巧结合起来，产生了前所未有的效果，将复活说成是基督的追随者们散布的一个纯粹的谣言，并将超自然因素完全从福音书中剔除。《耶稣的生活》在出版的第一年就卖出了6万多本(Renan 1991: vii; McManners 1972:16)。自然科学的发现同样重要。例如，1862年，达尔文的《物种起源》的法文译本出版，其序言否认了基督教的创世论，普法战争之后，雷南认为德国科学和世俗教育的广泛公认优越性是造成色当灾难的原因之一。从今以后，像涂尔干这样有前途的年轻人将被送往德国学习，他们也将像涂尔干一样回国，致力于推翻精英主义、人道主义和基本上由天主教支持的法国教育体系。因此，反教权主义不仅与实证主义和经验主义密切相关，而且与国内和国际政治也密切相关。

For those wishing to understand Durkheim, however, the most interesting aspect of anticlericalism was its similarity to Catholicism. In each case, a determined core of “true believers’’ was outnumbered by a wider circle of occasional conformists and nominal adherents. Moreover, the spheres of nominal Catholicism and ambiguous anticlericalism overlapped, as those Catholics who resented clerical domination and right-wing politics mingled with anticlericals — like Durkheim — whose hatred for priests was not unmixed with a respect and even nostalgia for the moral uniformity of the medieval community. It was in this context that the possibility of a purely lay morality, based on a “science of ethics,'' was ®rst conceived; and it was the belief in this possibility, as well as the quasi-religious belief in science and progress generally, which distinguished this anticlericalism from that of earlier ages: “Many of the opponents of the Church,'' McManners reminds us, “had a reluctant admiration for the system of moral influence they were proposing to destroy, and a vision of a faith to replace it. It was not ecrasez I’Infame, but a different sort of bitterness, compounded of attraction and repulsion, a love-hate relationship” (1972: 17). As we shall see in chapter 2 (see esp. pp. 48-9), even Durkheim's attitude toward the Church was not unmixed: “there were aspects of Catholicism,” Pickering reminds us, that Durkheim “greatly respected and continued to do so to the end of his life'' (1984: 427)

然而，对于那些希望理解涂尔干的人来说，反教权主义最有趣的方面是它与天主教的相似之处。在每种情况下，一个坚定的核心“真正的信徒”超过了一个更广泛的圈子，偶尔墨守成规者和名义上的追随者。此外，名义上的天主教和模棱两可的反教权主义的领域是重叠的，因为那些憎恨神职人员统治和右派的天主教徒与反教权主义者混杂在一起ーー比如涂尔干ーー他们对神父的仇恨并非完全与对中世纪社会道德一致性的尊重、甚至怀念混杂在一起。正是在这种背景下，基于“道德科学”的纯粹的非宗教道德的可能性被首次构想出来; 正是对这种可能性的信仰，以及对科学和进步的准宗教信仰，将这种反教权主义与早期时代区分开来: “教会的许多反对者,”麦克曼纳斯提醒我们，“对他们提议摧毁的道德影响系统，以及取而代之的信仰愿景，怀有一种勉强的钦佩。这并不是一种恶名，而是一种不同类型的痛苦，混合着吸引和排斥，一种爱恨交织的关系”(1972:17)。正如我们将在第二章中看到的。第48-9页) ，甚至涂尔干对教会的态度也不是纯粹的: “有天主教的方面,”皮克林提醒我们，涂尔干“非常尊重，并继续这样做，直到他的生命结束”(1984:427)

The Opportunists who came to power in 1879 thus confronted a Church afflicted with serious internal and external dif®culties, whose values were largely if not unambiguously discordant with the middle-class, quasi-religious belief in positivism and social progress, and whose political candidates they had repeatedly (and now decisively) defeated at the polls; but it was also a Church which had the respect and even affection of the majority of the population, one whose moral authority the Opportunists envied and longed to replace with their own, equally fervent brand of secular ethics.[7](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark18) More pragmatically, while radicals like Paul Bert might attack the State-supported religion and seek to overthrow the Concordat, Opportunists like Ferry saw the Concordat as an instrument for controlling the Church, particularly through the opportunities for clerical appointments and the suspension or abolition of ecclesiastical salaries it provided. And Leo XIII, who had replaced Pius IX in 1878, was considerably less hostile to a France which protected overseas missions and seemed benign by comparison with the newly unified Italy or Bismarckian Germany. Through his nuncio in Paris, the pope urged French Catholics to practice moderation in response to the new republican policies (McManners 1972: 45; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 85).

1879年上台的机会主义者因此面对的是一个饱受严重的内部和外部挑战的教会，它的价值观如果不是毫不含糊地与中产阶级、对实证主义和社会进步的准宗教信仰不一致，它的政治候选人在投票中屡次(现在是决定性的)被击败; 但它也是一个受到大多数人尊重甚至喜爱的教会，它的道德权威被机会主义者羡慕并渴望用他们自己同样狂热的世俗伦理品牌取代。7更务实的说，当像保罗 · 伯特这样的激进分子可能攻击国家支持的宗教并试图推翻协约时，像费里这样的机会主义者将协约视为控制教会的工具，特别是通过提供神职人员任命的机会以及暂停或废除它提供的教会工资。而在1878年取代庇护九世的利奥十三世，对一个保护海外使团的法国的敌意要少得多，与新统一的意大利或俾斯麦德国相比，他似乎是仁慈的。通过他在巴黎的大使，教皇敦促法国天主教徒对新的共和政策实行温和的回应(麦克曼纳斯1972:45; 梅耶尔和雷贝里乌1984:85)。

Republican administrators thus turned quite naturally to the Church’s educational establishments - “the surest guarantee of its continued influence’’ — as the focal point for their reforms. In such establishments, McManners emphasizes, “so many young minds were imprinted with a permanent allegiance to religion, or a subconscious residual respect for its practices’’ (1972: 45). Such establishments also bore the weight of accumulated resentments — they were patronized by the upper classes, administered corporal punishment, taught children to admire unrevolutionary mendicant saints, and emphasized impractical subjects to the children of a class with rising social aspirations. “A frontal attack on religion,’’ McManners emphasizes, “on the ceremonies by which wives set so much store, the consolations available in the hour of death, the cure and all his supporters,” would surely have failed (1972: 46). But a “flank attack’’ on clerical education, which left the Church undisturbed in the private sphere of the family, would surely receive political support. This support was eagerly sought. “The most urgent of all reforms,’’ Gambetta had declared upon signing the Belleville program of 1869, “must be the liberation of universal suffrage from every sort of tutelage, obstacle, pressure and corruption'' (Bury, 1985: 156). Indeed, “universal suffrage’’ had voted Royalist or Bonapartist in 1849, 1851, and 1852, and would do so again in 1870 and 1871. The way to ensure that it would vote republican, or so thought the republicans, was to provide free, compulsory, and above all secular primary education.

因此，共和党管理者很自然地把教会的教育机构作为他们改革的焦点——“教会继续发挥影响力的最可靠保证”。麦克曼纳斯强调，在这样的机构中，“如此多的年轻人被烙上了对宗教永久忠诚的印记，或是对其实践的潜意识残余的尊重”(1972:45)。这些机构也承受着积累的怨恨ーー它们受到上层阶级的资助，实施体罚，教育孩子们崇拜不革命的乞丐圣徒，并向社会抱负不断上升的阶级的孩子强调不切实际的课题。麦克曼纳斯强调: “对宗教的正面攻击，对于妻子们如此重视的仪式，对于死亡时刻可以得到的安慰，对于治愈和他的支持者,”肯定会失败(1972:46)。但是对神职人员教育的“侧翼攻击”，使教会不受家庭私人领域的干扰，肯定会得到政治支持。人们热切地寻求这种支持。甘贝塔在1869年签署贝尔维尔计划时宣称，“所有改革中最紧迫的，必须是将普选权从各种监护、障碍、压力和腐败中解放出来”(布里，1985:156)。事实上，“普选权”在1849年、1851年和1852年曾投票支持保皇党或波拿巴派，并在1870年和1871年再次投票支持保皇党或波拿巴派。确保它投票支持共和党，或者说共和党人是这样认为的，方法是提供免费的、义务的、最重要的是世俗的初等教育。

Laicization, however, was more than a means to winning over new generations to the Opportunist regime. After the disasters of 1870—1, it became a commonplace to compare pupils of the Jesuits with the more efficient German officer corps, “trained in academies which honoured Protestantism and science.’’ Laicization was thus viewed as a means to repair the negative consequences of an elitist, humanist, and increasingly impractical form of education, to eradicate differences of geographic region and social class, and to unite the French people and restore their sense of national pride. Secularism, in short, became synonymous with patriotism. Ferry ordered 20,000 copies of Deroulede’s Chants du soldat (1872) — a collection of popular, patriotic hymns — to be distributed to the primary schools, extolled military training for children, and advocated the creation of cadet battalions in Paris. The motto of the Ligue de l’Enseignement became “for the fatherland, by book and sword,’’ and Ferdinand Buisson, Director of Primary Education at the Ministry of Public Instruction from 1879 to 1896, sat on the managing committee of the Ligue des patriotes as well (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 86; McManners 1972: 47). The morality of the state, Claude Langlois agrees, “would replace that of the Church; the government’s truth would replace the Vatican’s. Rather than smash old idols, the Republic merely substituted new ones’’ (1996: 109-10).

然而，自由化不仅仅是为了赢得新一代机会主义政权的手段。在1870年1月的灾难之后，将耶稣会的学生与更有效率的德国军官队伍相比较成为了一种普遍现象，“他们在尊重新教和科学的学院里接受训练。”因此，法语化被视为一种修复精英主义、人文主义和越来越不切实际的教育形式的负面后果的手段，消除地理区域和社会阶层的差异，团结法国人民，恢复他们的民族自豪感。简而言之，世俗主义成了爱国主义的同义词。费里订购了2万册德鲁莱德的《士兵圣歌》(1872年) ，这是一本广受欢迎的爱国主义圣歌集，将分发给小学，赞扬为儿童提供的军事训练，并主张在巴黎建立少年军营。教育联盟的座右铭变成了“为了祖国，用书和剑”，费迪南·比松在1879年至1896年期间担任公共教育部的小学教育主任，也是爱国者同盟管理委员会的成员(迈耶和雷贝里奥1984:86; 麦克曼纳1972:47)。国家的道德，Claude Langlois 同意，“将取代教会的道德; 政府的真理将取代梵蒂冈的道德。而不是粉碎旧的偶像，共和国只是取代新的”(1996:109-10)。

In sum, laicization — the removal of clerical control over French education — was less a neutral political posture than a “civil religion’’ of its own, deeply inspired by neo-Kantian morality and Liberal Protestantism. Buisson founded the newspaper Le Christianisme liberal at Neuchatel in 1866, and in 1869 published La Foi lai'que, calling for a Christianity freed from obligatory dogma, the belief in miracles, infallible books, and priestly authority, and while Director of Primary Education was heard to speak of hymns and ceremonies for a new “mystique civile religieuse.’’ Felix Pecaut, a former pastor and Director of Studies at the Ecole Normale Superieure of Fontenay-aux-Roses, gave future heads and mistresses of teachers’ training colleges a lecture on morality each morning, followed by a secular hymn. Other Republicans were less given to such enthusiasms, but all believed in science, progress, and patriotism (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 86—7; McManners 1972: 47—8). As Claude Nicolet observed, the republicans were thus made aware of “the fundamental and ineluctable link between the political and the spiritual,’’ for “the anticlerical battle was the prerequisite of all political action,’’ and thus quite literally “the motor of history’’ (Langlois 1996: 120).

总而言之，在新康德主义道德和自由新教的深深鼓舞下，去教会化ーー即取消神职人员对法国教育的控制ーー与其说是一种中立的政治姿态，不如说是一种自身的“公民宗教”。布松于1866年在纽沙特尔创办了《基督教自由报》 ，并于1869年出版了《 La Foi lai‘ que 》 ，呼吁基督教摆脱强制性的教条、对奇迹、绝对正确的书籍和牧师权威的信仰，而小学教育主任则谈到了一种新的“神秘的民间宗教”的赞美诗和仪式菲利克斯•皮考特(Felix Pecaut)曾是一名牧师，也是高等师范学校丰特奈-玫瑰的研究主任。他每天早上给未来的教师培训学院的院长和情妇们做一次关于道德的讲座，之后是一首世俗的赞美诗。其他共和党人对此热情较少，但他们都相信科学、进步和爱国主义(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:86ー7; McManners 1972:47ー8)。正如克劳德 · 尼克莱特所观察到的，共和党人因此意识到了“政治和精神之间的根本和不可避免的联系”，因为“反教权的斗争是所有政治行动的先决条件”，因此，从字面上看，“历史的发动机”(Langlois 1996:120)。

In spite of its non-revolutionary goals — or rather because of them — the movement toward laicization grew rapidly. The Ligue de l’enseignement, founded in 1866 by Jean Mace, served as an umbrella for a variety of disparate groups unified in dehning free, compulsory, secular education as the overriding national necessity. From 1870 to 1877, it grew from 18,000 to 60,000 members (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 86). “The organizers of the league,’’ Auspitz observes, “deliberately set out to establish a secular voice and organization in French politics, a presence in every commune and department that would urge the existing government in a ‘modern’ direction and provide an alternative to a society based on the Catholic Church’’ (Auspitz 1982: 6—7). Similarly, the Sociee tee pour l’etude des questions d’enseignement superieur, founded in 1879, sought to influence sympathetic ministers like W. H. Waddington and Ferry to reform higher education on the model of Protestant Germany; and the Revue internationale de l'enseignement, which began to appear in 1881, presented a series of studies of both German and French education ± including the important products of Durkheim's i885±6 visit to Berlin, Marburg, and Leipzig ± which created the theoretical foundations for the policies of laicization.

尽管其非革命性的目标ーー或者更确切地说是因为这些目标ーー但是走向平民化的运动迅速发展。教育联盟成立于1866年，由让 · 梅斯(Jean Mace)创立，它是各种不同团体的保护伞，这些团体统一起来，将免费的、义务的、世俗的教育作为国家的首要需要。从1870年到1877年，它的成员从18,000增加到60,000(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:86)。奥斯匹兹注意到，“联盟的组织者有意在法国政治中建立一个世俗的声音和组织，在每一个公社和部门都有存在，敦促现有的政府朝着‘现代’的方向发展，为基于天主教会的社会提供另一种选择”(奥斯匹兹1982:6ー7)。类似的，成立于1879年的高等教育问题研究学会(Sociee pour l’etude des questions d’enseignement supereur)试图影响同情他们的部长，比如瓦丁顿(W.H. Waddington)和费里(Ferry) ，按照新教德国的模式对高等教育进行改革; 1881年开始出版的《国际教育评论》(Revue international ale de l’enseignement)对德国和法国的教育进行了一系列研究，包括迪尔凯姆访问柏林、马堡和莱比锡的重要成果，这些成果为非宗教化政策奠定了理论基础。

On February 4, 1879, the Waddington ministry was formed with Jules Ferry as Minister of Education. On March 30, 1885, the second Ferry cabinet would be overthrown by news of the Lang Son disaster, a minor reversal in the Third Republic's aggressive colonial policies seized upon by Ferry's opponents. During the period of remarkable political stability which intervened, Ferry would be Minister of Education for ®ve years and Prime Minister for three; and it was during this period, undisturbed by opposition from both Left and Right, that the governing republicans constructed their system of free, compulsory, secular education. Born near St. Die in the Vosges, Ferry embodied a variety of conflicting religious impulses. His father and the males of his family were Voltairean free-thinkers; by marriage he would enter the milieu of rich Protestantism; and his sister Adele, who raised him, was a fervent Catholic who constantly prayed for his salvation. Like Gambetta, Ferry was trained at the bar and won his political reputation in the opposition struggle near the end of the Second Empire; but in 1870, while Gambetta became the hero of the French provinces, Ferry held the thankless tasks of rationing food supplies and suppressing the January insurrection in Paris, for which he won the successive titles of “Ferry-Famine” and “Ferry-Massacre.” But, despite his understandable unpopularity with a section of the Parisians, Ferry won increasing respect during the 1870s, until he became the acknowledged leader of the Gauche Republicaine, one of two main opposition groups in parliament (Bury 1985: 155).

1879年2月4日，沃丁顿教会成立，朱尔斯 · 费里担任教育部长。1885年3月30日，第二届渡轮内阁将被郎山灾难的消息推翻，第三共和国的侵略性殖民政策被渡轮的反对者抓住，这是一个小小的逆转。在政局非常稳定的时期，费里担任了五年的教育部长和三年的总理; 正是在这段时期，在左翼和右翼的反对声中，执政的共和党人建立了他们的免费、义务和世俗教育体系。费里出生在 St. Die in the Vosges 附近，体现了各种相互冲突的宗教冲动。他的父亲和家族中的男性都是伏尔泰式的自由思想者; 通过婚姻，他将进入富有的新教环境; 而他的妹妹阿黛尔，抚养他长大，是一个狂热的天主教徒，不断为他的救赎祈祷。与甘贝塔一样，费里也是在酒吧接受训练的，并在第二帝国末期的反对派斗争中赢得了政治声誉。但在1870年，当甘贝塔成为法国各省的英雄时，费里承担了定量配给食品供应和镇压一月份巴黎起义这些吃力不讨好的任务，为此他连续赢得了“费里饥荒”和“费里大屠杀”的称号但是，尽管他在巴黎的一部分人中不受欢迎是可以理解的，费里在19世纪70年代赢得了越来越多的尊重，直到他成为高屈共和党的公认领导人，这是议会中两个主要反对派团体之一(伯里1985:155)。

Not surprisingly, Ferry’s primary intellectual inspiration came from Condorcet and Comte, whose beliefs in science, progress, and the power of education he embraced without reservation. But, much like Durkheim, Ferry also held a deep respect for the medieval Church, whose schools uni®ed society, mitigated inequalities, taught morality, and thus provided the ethical foundations for an entire social order. “So too,’’ McManners explains Ferry’s thinking, “the new lay education would unite Frenchmen in a common patriotism, ®tting them for the day when they would challenge the Germans and recover Ferry’s homeland of Lorraine; it would help the poor to rise, give women equality with men, and in the factories, where hierarchy was inevitable, it would make inferiority tolerable by creating an equality of dignity. As for morality, at last it could be separated from those ‘high metaphysical questions about which theologians and philosophers have disputed for 6,000 years’ ’’ (1972: 49).

毫不奇怪，费里的主要知识灵感来自 Condorcet 和孔德，他们对科学、进步和教育的力量的信仰让他毫无保留地接受。但是，就像涂尔干一样，费里也对中世纪教会怀有深深的敬意，他们的学校联合了社会，减少了不平等，教授道德，从而为整个社会秩序提供了道德基础。麦克曼纳斯解释了费里的想法，“新的非专业教育将法国人团结在一个共同的爱国主义之中，告诉他们有朝一日他们将挑战德国，收复费里的故乡洛林; 它将帮助穷人崛起，给予女性与男性平等的地位，在等级制度不可避免的工厂里，它将通过创造尊严平等，使低人一等变得可以容忍。至于道德，它终于可以从那些‘神学家和哲学家争论了6000年的高度形而上学的问题’中分离出来。”(1972:49)。

The republican ascendancy of 1879—85 is recalled primarily for its anticlerical legislation; but in fact, laicization as a general policy was directly or indirectly related to a variety of other reforms. The Opportunists began, for example, by eliminating those legal measures from which they had suffered in the days of “moral order.’’ A drinking shop law made it possible to open or move a tavern — the Republican “church” — without administrative authorization. A law of June 30, 1881 made it possible to hold public meetings without similar authorization, requiring only a simple declaration and the formation of a committee. A law of July 29, 1881 granted an extraordinary degree of freedom to the press, resulting in an unprecedented expansion of journals for the expression of opinion. A law of March 4, 1882 granted municipal councils the right to elect their mayors; and a law of April 5, 1884 conhrmed the election of mayors and their deputies, as well as the public nature of council meetings: “The town halls,’’ Mayeur and Reberioux explain, “were centres of life and political education, especially in the country. The activities of the municipal councils, especially in religious affairs (subsidies for buildings, payment of curates, vetoes on processions) and educational matters (creation of schools, laicization of the staff) were the occasions of important debates’’ (Mayeur and Reberioux, 1984: 82). Administrative and constitutional reforms were limited. Once in power, the Opportunists abandoned the rhetoric of decentralization, preserving the administrative structure established by Napoleon. The “republican form of government” was made immune to revision, a measure which made royalist propaganda into an act against the constitution. A constitutional revision of 1884 abandoned the creation of further life-senators, and recruitment by competitive examination was introduced into the Diplomatic Service, the Conseil d’Etat, the Cours des comptes, and the Inspection des hnances. But the electoral laws maintained the dominance of rural France, and the extreme Left failed to achieve its goals of universal suffrage and the abolition of the upper chamber (Bury 1985: 153—5; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 82—3).

1879-85年共和政体的优势主要是因为它的反教会立法而被人们回忆起来; 但事实上，合法化作为一项总的政策直接或间接地与其他各种改革有关。例如，机会主义者一开始就取消了那些他们在“道德秩序”时期遭受的法律措施一项饮料店法案使得在没有行政授权的情况下开设或移动酒馆ーー共和党的“教堂”ーー成为可能。1881年6月30日的一项法律允许在没有类似授权的情况下举行公开会议，只需要简单的声明和成立一个委员会。1881年7月29日颁布的一项法律给予新闻界极大程度的自由，导致表达意见的期刊空前扩张。1882年3月4日的一项法律赋予市议会选举市长的权利; 1884年4月5日的一项法律规定了市长及其副手的选举，以及议会会议的公共性质: “市政厅,”迈耶尔和雷贝里奥解释说，“是生活和政治教育的中心，特别是在这个国家。市议会的活动，特别是在宗教事务(建筑补贴，牧师的支付，游行的否决权)和教育事务(创建学校，工作人员的合法化)是重要的辩论场合”(Mayeur 和 Reberioux，1984:82)。行政和宪法改革受到限制。一旦掌权，机会主义者放弃了地方分权的花言巧语，保留了拿破仑建立的行政结构。“共和政体”不受修改的影响，这一措施使保皇党的宣传变成了违反宪法的行为。1884年的宪法修正案放弃了进一步设立终身参议员的做法，通过竞争性考试进行招聘的做法被引入到外交部、国务委员会、财政法院和社会事务监察部门。但是选举法保持了法国农村的统治地位，极左派未能实现其普选权和废除上议院的目标(伯里1985:153ー5; 梅耶和雷贝里乌1984:82ー3)。

The intimate connection between laicization and the revival of French political fortunes was reflected in colonial policies as well. Explaining to the Chamber why he sent Admiral Courbet’s squadron into the Gulf of Tonkin in 1885 — an act which eventually brought about his fall — Ferry presented arguments which were simultaneously economic, humanitarian, and political. France was committed irretrievably to industrialization, and the colonies would provide markets for her products in the face of mounting international protectionism; the “superior races’’ had a duty “to civilize the inferior races,’’ by exporting enlightenment and social progress; and an expansionist policy was the mark of national greatness, while one of contemplation or abstention was simply a further step on the road to decline and decadence. So there was no apparent contradiction between laicization and colonial expansion; on the contrary, the first seemed to justify the second: “After all,’’ Mayeur and Reberioux observe, “laicization taught the end of traditional beliefs and civilizations and the victory of a progress based on science and reason. The Alliance Francaise, founded in 1884, aimed at disseminating this ideal beyond the seas. Once again we can see that there is unity in the opportunist republicans’ conception of the world and their political philosophy” (1984: 99—100).

殖民政策也反映了法国政治命运的复兴与民间化之间的密切联系。在向议会解释他为什么在1885年派遣库尔贝海军上将的中队进入 Gulf of Tonkin (这一行为最终导致了他的下台)时，费里提出了同时兼顾经济、人道主义和政治的论点。法国不可挽回地致力于工业化，面对日益增长的国际保护主义，殖民地将为她的产品提供市场; “优等民族”有责任通过输出启蒙和社会进步“使劣等民族文明化”; 扩张主义政策是国家伟大的标志，而沉思或节制只是在衰落和堕落的道路上迈进了一步。因此，合法化与殖民扩张之间并不存在明显的矛盾; 相反，前者似乎证明了后者的合理性: “毕竟,”梅耶尔和雷贝里乌观察到，“合法化教导传统信仰和文明的终结，教导基于科学和理性的进步的胜利。法国联盟成立于1884年，旨在向海外传播这一理想。我们再一次看到，机会主义共和主义者的世界观和他们的政治哲学是一致的”(1984:99ー100)。

Laicization, in short, was the reform that contained all other reforms: “when the whole of French youth has . . . grown up under this triple aegis of free, compulsory, secular education’’ Ferry predicted in the Revue pedagogique in 1882, “we shall have nothing more to fear from returns to the past, for we shall have the means of defending ourselves. [This means consists of] the spirit of all these new generations, of these countless young reserves of republican democracy, trained in the school of science and reason, who will block retrograde attitudes with the insurmountable obstacle of free minds and liberated consciences” (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 85). Quite outside the sphere of education, the Ferry reforms included a number of measures designed to destroy the traditional, almost subliminal presence of the Church in the everyday lives of French citizens. In 1880, for example, the law which forbade work on Sundays was annulled. A law of July 28, 1881 abolished the denominational character of cemeteries; and another law of November 15, 1887 encouraged citizens to make preliminary arrangements for civil funerals. Mayors of communes were given control of religious processions; hospitals were laicized through the gradual expulsion of the Sisters of Mercy; crucifixes were removed from courtrooms; clergy were eliminated from the administration of charitable organizations; army and military hospital chaplains were abolished; prayers at the opening of each parliamentary session were abolished; and on July 27, 1884, divorce was restored to the Civil Code, from where it had been absent since 1816.[8](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark19)

简而言之，俗化是包含所有其他改革的改革: “当整个法国青年... ... 在这种自由、义务和世俗教育的三重庇护下成长起来时,”费里在1882年的《滑稽教育》(Revue)中预言，“我们将不再害怕回到过去，因为我们将拥有保护自己的手段。”。[这意味着]所有这些新一代的精神，这些无数年轻的共和民主储备，在科学和理性学校接受培训，他们将阻止倒退的态度与不可逾越的障碍，自由的思想和解放的良心”(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:85)。在教育领域之外，渡轮改革包括一系列旨在摧毁教会在法国公民日常生活中几乎潜意识存在的传统措施。例如，在1880年，禁止星期天工作的法律被废除了。1881年7月28日的一项法律废除了墓地的教派性质; 1887年11月15日的另一项法律鼓励公民为公民葬礼作出初步安排。公社的市长被赋予控制宗教游行的权力; 医院被逐步驱逐出仁爱修女会; 十字架被从法庭上移除; 神职人员被从慈善组织的管理中取消; 军队和军队医院的牧师被取消; 在每届议会开幕式上的祈祷被取消; 1884年7月27日，离婚恢复到《民法典》中，自1816.8年以来，离婚一直没有出现

On July 14,1880, the anniversary of the Fall of the Bastille was observed as a national festival for the first time since the Revolution. Schoolchildren were required to participate, in order to “rescue the younger generations from superstitious practices,” and replace the “old dogmas” with the new, civil religion. “It would be very wrong,” Mayeur and Reberioux insist, “to underestimate the popular fervor and enthusiasm on the occasion of the first festivals of the 14 July and to fail to recognize the emotional power of the myth of the Republic . . . The popular festival with its balls in the squares and fireworks was a sort of political liturgy” (1984: 118). Durkheim himself spent the entire day celebrating in the streets (Lukes 1972: 48). In the sphere of education per se, a law of February, 1880 excluded from the Conseil Superieur de l’Instruction Publique those “not involved in education and in particular ministers of religion,” thus ending the system created by the Loi Falloux and reinstating the university as an autonomous body. Henceforth, the Conseil Superieur would play an essential part in producing the reform legislation of the Third Republic, through its permanent committee as well as specialized associations like the Society for the Study of Questions of Secondary Education and the Society of Higher Education. Another law of March 18, 1880 ended the practice, established in July, 1875, of conferring university degrees by mixed boards of examiners: “The examinations and practical tests which determine the award of degrees,” the new law stated, “can only be taken before State faculties.'' The same law denied the title of “university” to the Catholic “institutes of higher education” given life by the 1875 legislation (Mayeur and Reberioux, 1984: 87-8).

1880年7月14日，巴士底狱沦陷周年纪念日被作为一个全国性的节日，这是自大革命以来的第一次。为了“把年轻一代从迷信习俗中拯救出来”，并用新的公民宗教取代“旧教条”，学校要求学生参与。梅耶尔和雷贝里乌坚持认为: “在7月14日的第一个节日之际，低估民众的热情和热情，并且没有认识到共和国神话的情感力量，这将是非常错误的... ... 在广场上举行舞会和放烟火的民众节日是一种政治礼拜”(1984:118)。涂尔干自己花了一整天的时间在街上庆祝(路加福音1972:48)。在教育领域，1880年2月的一项法律将那些“不参与教育，特别是不参与宗教事务”的人排除在教育公共委员会之外，从而结束了法罗会议创建的体制，恢复了大学的自治机构。今后，最高委员会将通过其常设委员会以及中等教育问题研究学会和高等教育学会等专门协会，在制定第三共和国的改革立法方面发挥重要作用。1880年3月18日的另一项法律终止了1875年7月确立的由混合考试委员会授予大学学位的做法: “决定授予学位的考试和实践测试,”新法律规定，“只能在国家教职人员之前进行。”同样的法律否认了1875年立法赋予天主教“高等教育学院”的“大学”头衔(Mayeur and Reberioux，1984:87-8)。

Ferry's most controversial act, however, was his introduction of the infamous “Article 7,” which forbade members of unauthorized congregations to direct or teach in any educational establishment whatsoever. This revival of the question of State recognition for congregations was palpably a device to deprive certain citizens, and particularly the Jesuits, of their right to teach. It was thus as unpalatable for some on the Left as for those on the Right and, after a violent debate, the article was rejected by the Senate. Undeterred, Ferry and Freycinet simply decided to enforce the already-existing, long-unobserved statutes against unauthorized congregations. In the decrees of March 29, 1880, therefore, Ferry ordered the dissolution and disbandment of the Jesuits within three months. All other congregations which failed to obtain permission to reside and operate in France within a prescribed time period were also to be dissolved. Conservatives and Catholics were passionately indignant. A number of communities refused to obey the decrees, and approximately 400 magistrates resigned rather then enforce them. In the case of refusal, however, troops were called in to secure the expulsion, and the resignation of conservatively disposed magistrates simply provided Ferry with the opportunity to replace them with magistrates whose Republican sentiments were unquali®ed. It is a clear measure of the government's popular support that, in all but a few departments, the Catholic right failed miserably in its efforts to mobilize crowds against this, perhaps the most heavy-handed act of laicization (Bury 1985: 158; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 77).

然而，费里最具争议的行为是他引入了臭名昭著的“第七条”，该条禁止未经授权的教会成员在任何教育机构指导或教学。重新提出国家承认教会的问题显然是一种剥夺某些公民，特别是耶稣会教徒教学权利的手段。因此，对于一些左翼人士和右翼人士来说，这篇文章同样令人不快。经过激烈辩论后，这篇文章被参议院否决。费里和弗雷西内并没有被吓倒，他们只是决定执行已经存在的、长期未被遵守的法规来对付未经授权的教会。因此，在1880年3月29日的法令中，费里下令在三个月内解散和解散耶稣会。未能在规定期限内获准在法国居住和运作的所有其他教会也应解散。保守派和天主教徒愤怒不已。一些社区拒绝遵守这些法令，大约400名治安法官辞职，而不是执行这些法令。然而，在遭到拒绝的情况下，部队被召来确保驱逐出境，保守派治安法官的辞职只是为 Ferry 提供了一个机会，可以用其共和党情绪毫无疑问的治安法官取代他们。这清楚地表明了政府的民意支持，除了少数几个部门，天主教右翼在动员人民反对这一可能是最严厉的合法化行为的努力中惨遭失败(Bury1985:158; Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:77)。

If the religious congregations were thus to be ousted, however, it was the obligation of the State to provide for the education of every child in France. The essential stipulation here was that such education be free, compulsory, and secular. “Making it free,” Mayeur and Reberioux explain, “made it possible to make it compulsory and this, in a country divided in its beliefs, involved making it secular” (1984: 89). The decisive measure here was the law of March 28, 1882, which made education compulsory from six to thirteen years, and eliminated religious instruction from the timetable. The teacher, insisted Buisson, “confines himself to inculcating in his pupils the fundamental ideas which recur in all religious denominations and even outside them” (1984: 90). The phrase “every child in France” was meant to include females. As early as 1878, Camille See, a young Jewish deputy in Ferry’s party, had proposed a bill which sought to end the influence of the Church over middle-class girls by providing them with State-supported, secondary education; and on December 21, 1880, this bill became a law. The education provided by the Camille See law was innovative in two ways. First, it was to be provided by female schoolmistresses, a condition which required the creation of teachers’ training colleges for women. Indeed, a decree of August, 1879 had already ordered each department to establish an Ecole Normale for this purpose, and in July, 1880, an Ecole Normale Superieure was established at Fontenay-aux-Roses, under the leadership of the Protestant Pecaut, to train lecturers for these colleges. Second, this education was to be secular - i.e., the teaching of morality was compulsory but that of religion was optional. By ending “intellectual and moral divorce’’ in marriage, the law sought to provide “republican companions for republican men.’’ Ferry, in particular, was delighted with a measure which carried women “towards the light, towards knowledge, towards secular science’’ (1984: 89).

然而，如果宗教团体因此而被驱逐，国家有义务为法国的每个儿童提供教育。这里的基本规定是这种教育是免费的、义务的和世俗的。Mayeur 和 Reberioux 解释说: “让它自由，使它成为强制性的可能，这在一个信仰分裂的国家里，涉及到使它世俗化”(1984:89)。这里的决定性措施是1882年3月28日的法律，该法律规定教育从六年到十三年为义务教育，并从时间表中取消了宗教教育。布松坚持认为，这位教师“将自己局限于向学生灌输在所有宗教派别甚至在宗教派别之外都重复出现的基本思想”(1984:90)。“法国的每个孩子”这个短语本意是包括女性。早在1878年，费里政党的年轻犹太代表卡米尔 · 西(Camille See)就提出了一项法案，旨在通过向中产阶级女孩提供国家支持的中等教育，结束教会对她们的影响。1880年12月21日，这项法案成为法律。Camille See 法律提供的教育在两个方面具有创新性。首先是由女教师提供，这一条件要求建立女子师范学院。事实上，1879年8月的一项法令已经命令每个部门为此目的建立一个师范学院，并在1880年7月，一个高等师范学校成立了丰特奈-玫瑰，在新教皮考特的领导下，为这些学院培训讲师。其次，这种教育是世俗的——也就是说，道德教育是强制性的，而宗教教育是可选择的。通过结束婚姻中的“智力和道德离婚”，该法律试图为“共和党人提供共和党伴侣”费里特别高兴的是，一项措施使妇女“走向光明，走向知识，走向世俗科学”(1984:89)。

The complete laicization of the teaching staffs came more slowly, as Ferry wished to avoid any disruptive opposition and, in any case, needed the time to train the appropriate teachers. By the appearance of the “Goblet law’’ of October 30, 1886, however, members of the religious orders were explicitly denied further recruitment into the State’s primary schools, and their replacement with exclusively lay personnel was required within the next five years. In secondary education, the timetable was reformed in 1880 to reduce the role, so prominent in Jesuit pedagogical method, of memorization, composition, and Latin recitation. The classical humanistic subjects retained their primacy, but science and modern languages were given a larger place, and an underlying philosophy of educational realism became perceptible: “The observation of things,’’ Ferry emphasized, “is the basis of everything.’’[9](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark20) Ferry and his successors also worked to restore the rapidly stagnating French system of higher education. Chairs and lectureships were created, new faculties were built, the reconstruction of the Sorbonne was started in 1889, and a plan was prepared (to be fully implemented in the law of July 10, 1896) for the creation of autonomous universities uniting the faculties and schools of individual towns. The magnitude of the change was reflected in the national budget. From 1875 to 1879, more money was allocated to religious functions than to public education (55 million francs versus 46 million), while from 1885 to 1889, spending on the former had declined to 48 million versus 120 million on the latter (Langlois 1996: 121).

由于费里希望避免任何破坏性的反对，并且在任何情况下都需要时间来培训合适的教师，因此教师的完全合法化进展较为缓慢。然而，1886年10月30日的《高脚杯法》出台后，宗教团体的成员被明确拒绝进入国家的小学，并要求在接下来的五年内用专门的非宗教人员取代他们。在中等教育中，时间表在1880年进行了改革，以减少耶稣会教育方法中突出的记忆、作文和拉丁文背诵的作用。古典人文主义学科保留了它们的首要地位，但科学和现代语言被赋予了更大的地位，教育现实主义的潜在哲学变得可以感知: “观察事物,”费里强调，“是一切的基础。”费里及其继任者还致力于恢复迅速停滞的法国高等教育体系。1889年开始了 Sorbonne 的重建，并制定了一项计划(将在1896年7月10日的法律中全面实施) ，建立自治大学，将各个城镇的教师和学校联合起来。变化的幅度反映在国家预算中。从1875年到1879年，用于宗教活动的资金多于用于公共教育的资金(5500万法郎对4600万法郎) ，而从1885年到1889年，用于宗教活动的资金减少到4800万法郎，用于公共教育的资金减少到1.2亿法郎(Langlois 1996:121)。

In retrospect, the laicization of French education seems to have been completed even as, for a variety of reasons, its popular mandate evaporated. By 1886, for example, the Republic could no longer ignore Rome, where Leo XIII had largely restored the international prestige of the curia and was cultivating improved relations with Ger many. French diplomatic isolation could be avoided only through an alliance with the Tsar, who was unlikely to cast his lot with radical anticlericals. In the Near East and China, moreover, French influence depended in part upon the protectorate over missions conferred by Rome. Inseparable in the minds of Ferry and the other Opportunists, laicization and colonialism proved ill fitted to one another in practice. Anticlericalism, Gambetta stated succinctly, “is not for export” (McManners 1972: 61). Domestic political considerations were still more decisive. In the elections of 1885, conservative groups increased their seats from 100 to 201, while the republicans fell from 457 to 383, leaving the Chamber divided between three political blocks of roughly equal size. In the center were the “Opportunist” followers of Ferry and Gambetta; to their left was a somewhat larger group divided between radicals and the more extreme socialists; and on the right was a growing conservative opposition of either Bonapartist or Royalist persuasions. The political confidence which had inspired the forceful expulsion of religious orders from the universities was now thoroughly shaken (McManners 1972: 61, 62).

回顾过去，法国教育的平民化似乎已经完成，尽管由于种种原因，它的普遍授权已经消失。例如，到1886年，共和国再也不能忽视罗马，利奥十三世在那里基本上恢复了教廷的国际声望，并与德国许多国家建立了改善的关系。法国的外交孤立只能通过与沙皇结盟来避免，沙皇不太可能与激进的反教权主义者结盟。此外，在近东和中国，法国的影响力在一定程度上取决于对罗马授予的使命的英格兰联邦-护国公时期。在费里和其他机会主义者的心目中，庸俗化和殖民主义在实践中是不相容的。甘贝塔简洁地说，反教权主义“不是为了出口”(麦克曼纳斯1972:61)。国内的政治考量更为决定性。在1885年的选举中，保守派的席位从100个增加到201个，而共和党的席位从457个减少到383个，使得众议院分为三个规模大致相同的政治集团。在中间是费里和甘贝塔的“机会主义者”追随者; 在他们左边是一个较大的团体，分为激进派和更极端的社会主义者; 在右边是一个不断增长的保守派反对派，无论是波拿巴派还是保皇派。曾经鼓励强行驱逐宗教团体的政治信心现在彻底动摇了(麦克曼纳斯1972:61,62)。

Finally, the elimination of the possibility of presidential dissolution after the constitutional crisis of 1877 had been followed by a spirit of “proud irresponsibility” among the deputies in the Chamber: “Secure in their seats for a tenure of four years,” McManners observes, “incurably suspicious of intelligent leadership, and with local rather than national interests in the forefront of their minds, they made politics a game of intrigue and tried to keep the workings of a modern State under the day-to-day supervision of parliamentary debates” (1972: 61-2). It was the disillusionment with such politicians, exacerbated by the revelations of corruption which forced the resignation of President Grevy, which fed the Boulangist fires of 1887 and 1888. In the effort to persuade Catholics to withhold their support from General Boulanger, moderate republicans quite naturally tried to suppress their reputation for anticlericalism. By December, 1888, facing 200 supporters of the Church in the Chamber, Ferry publicly acknowledged that his anticlerical policies could not be pressed farther. But by then, of course, laicization was a fait accompli.

最后，在1877年宪法危机之后，总统解散的可能性被消除，紧随其后的是众议院议员中一种“骄傲的不负责任”的精神: “在四年的任期内保住他们的席位,”麦克曼纳斯评论道，“他们对明智的领导无可救药地持怀疑态度，他们把地方利益而不是国家利益放在心上，他们把政治变成了一场阴谋诡计的游戏，并试图将一个现代国家的运作置于议会辩论的日常监督之下”(1972:61-2)。正是对这些政治家的幻灭感，加上腐败的曝光迫使格雷维总统辞职，从而助长了1887年和1888年的布朗主义之火。为了说服天主教徒不要支持布朗热将军，机会主义共和派很自然地试图压制他们反教权主义的名声。到了1888年12月，面对议会中的200名教会支持者，费里公开承认他的反教会政策不能再继续下去了。但那时，当然，俗化已成既成事实。

The France that emerged from the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune thus comprised a variety of socio-economic strata ± e.g., an upper middle class long attracted to the belief in positivism and social progress; a “new social stratum” that sought enlightenment and upward mobility for its children; a peasantry increasingly exposed to improvements in transportation and communications, and as fearful of restoration as it was of revolution; a small industrial working class indifferent to revolutionary socialism, etc. ± whose shared ambitions were to avoid revolution and/or reaction, improve education and, above all, rise economically and socially. Loosely aligned, these strata constituted the infrastructure for the “Opportunists,” who found a stable, reliable source of political support in the reform that contained all other refor ms ± laicization.

从普法战争和巴黎公社崛起的法国由各种各样的社会经济阶层组成，例如，一个长期被实证主义和社会进步所吸引的中上层阶级，一个为其子女寻求启蒙和向上流动的“新社会阶层”，一个越来越多地接触到交通和通讯改善的农民，和对革命的恐惧一样害怕复兴，一个对革命社会主义漠不关心的小型工业工人阶级，等等，他们的共同目标是避免革命和/或反动，改善教育，最重要的是，在经济和社会上。松散地结合在一起，这些阶层构成了“机会主义者”的基础设施，他们在改革中发现了一个稳定、可靠的政治支持来源，其中包含了所有其他的改革。

A number of developments ± e.g., Quanta Cura and Pater aeternus, the ephemeral efflorescence of the Church following the Franco-Prussian War, a staggering Catholic majority in the general population, the resurgence of the religious congregations, virtually complete control of social services, its powerful role in education, etc. ± spawned fears that the strength of the Church was growing, and might prove an obstacle to the otherwise upwardly mobile bourgeois. But other factors ± lack of a central organization or distinctive French voice, internal division over ultramontanist policies, the poverty and low status of the clergy, attacks from Biblical critics, evolutionists, and social scientists, rural clergy ignorant of an increasingly urban world ± suggested that the Church was vulnerable to attack. This could not be a frontal attack, for the Church enjoyed the respect and affection of the majority of French citizens, and the Opportunists themselves were less interested in destroying its moral authority than replacing it with their own secular ethics. Instead, the Opportunists focused on the Church’s educational establishments, which bore the weight of numerous resentments, including its tradition of teaching impractical subjects to the children of a class with rising social aspirations. By associating the palpably superior German military with “academies which honoured Protestantism and science,'' the Opportunists effected a parallel association between secularism and patriotism.

一系列的发展，例如，广塔库拉和帕特永恒教会，教会在普法战争之后短暂的繁荣，天主教在普通人口中惊人的多数，宗教会众的复兴，几乎完全控制社会服务，它在教育中的强大作用，等等，引起了人们对教会的力量正在增长的恐惧，并可能成为向上流动的资产阶级的一个障碍。但其他因素 ± 缺乏一个中央组织或独特的法国声音，内部分歧的超蒙特派政策，贫穷和低地位的神职人员，攻击来自圣经批评家，进化论者和社会科学家，农村神职人员不知道一个日益城市化的世界 ± 表明，教会是易受攻击。这不可能是正面攻击，因为教会享有大多数法国公民的尊重和喜爱，机会主义者自己对摧毁教会的道德权威不感兴趣，而是用他们自己的世俗伦理取而代之。相反，机会主义者把注意力集中在教会的教育机构上，这些机构承受着无数的怨恨，包括教会向社会抱负不断上升的班级的孩子们传授不切实际的科目的传统。通过将明显优越的德国军队与“尊重新教和科学的学院”联系起来，机会主义者在世俗主义和爱国主义之间建立了类似的联系。

Theoretically, Langlois observes, this effort to ®nd a secular substitute for a discredited Catholicism was inspired by Rousseau's insistence, in Le Contrat social, that every society requires a common religious foundation as the basis of its morality; and operationally, it began with an appreciation of the immense success of the Church in mobilizing and indoctrinating the faithful, offering comfort even as it provoked feelings of guilt. When it came to training today's patriot or tomorrow's republican, therefore, it made sense to adapt Catholicism's sources of energy in order to generate revolutionary enthusiasm. “National education,'' Langlois thus cites the pastor Rabaut Saint-Etienne, “consists in seizing the child still in the cradle, and even earlier, for the unborn child already belongs to the nation. The nation takes hold of the whole person and never lets go'' (i996: 135)-

从理论上讲，朗格洛伊斯观察到，这种试图和一个世俗的替代一个失信的天主教的努力是受到卢梭的启发，在 Le Contrat 社会，坚持认为每个社会都需要一个共同的宗教基础作为其道德的基础，并在操作上，它开始于一个巨大的成功的教会动员和灌输的信徒，提供安慰，即使它引起的负罪感。因此，在培养今天的爱国主义者或明天的共和主义者时，为了激发革命热情，调整天主教的能量来源是有意义的。朗格洛瓦引用了牧师的拉布·圣艾蒂安，“国民教育就是抓住还在摇篮里的孩子，甚至更早，因为未出生的孩子已经属于国家。国家抓住整个人，永不放手”(i996:135)-

CHAPTER 2

第二章
 
## The subtlety of things 事情的微妙之处
 
In 1902, after a lengthy parliamentary inquiry into secondary education led by Louis Liard, a course in educational theory was created and immediately required of all candidates for the agregation at the university of Paris. Not without dif®culty, Liard persuaded Durkheim to take on the responsibility, and the course ± later published as L'Evolution pedagogique en France (1938) ± was taught at the Ecole Normale Superieure each year from 1904 to 1913 (Lukes 1972: 379). But there can be little doubt of Durkheim’s commitment to the project, which reflected his opinion of the reforms we have just described: “Everybody feels that [secondary education] cannot remain as it is,’’ he observed, “without having any clear idea about what it needs to become.’’ So here we see Durkheim’s skeptical, even cynical assessment of merely political reforms, in so far as they lacked a moral infrastructure. For Durkheim, the regulations and decrees of the previous twenty years “cannot have any real authority unless they have been proposed, planned, publicized, and in some way pleaded for by informed opinion, unless they express it in a thoughtful, clear, and co-ordinated way, instead of trying to create and control it through the medium of officialdom.’’ Moreover, it was essential that the “great task of reconstruction and reorganization” be the work of those people to be reorganized and reconstructed: “Ideals cannot be legislated into existence,’’ Durkheim echoed Rousseau’s discussion of civil religion, “they must be understood, loved and striven for by those whose duty is to realize them’’ (1977: 7±8).

1902年，在路易 · 利亚德领导的议会对中等教育进行了长时间的调查之后，设立了一门教育理论课程，并立即要求所有候选人参加巴黎大学的集会。利亚尔说服涂尔干承担起这个责任，这门课程后来以《法国进化教育学》(1938)的名字发表，从1904年到1913年，每年都在高等师范学校教学(卢克斯1972:379)。但迪尔凯姆对该项目的承诺几乎毫无疑问，这反映了他对我们刚才描述的改革的看法: “每个人都觉得(中等教育)不能保持现状,”他说，“对它需要变成什么没有任何明确的想法。”因此，我们在这里看到涂尔干的怀疑，甚至愤世嫉俗的评估，仅仅是政治改革，因为他们缺乏道德基础设施。对涂尔干来说，过去二十年的法规和法令“不可能有任何真正的权威，除非它们已经被提出、计划、公布，并以某种方式被知情的意见所恳求，除非它们以一种深思熟虑的、清晰的和协调的方式来表达，而不是试图通过官方媒介来创造和控制它。”此外，“重建和重组的伟大任务”必须是那些需要重组和重建的人们的工作: “理想不能立法成为现实,”涂尔干重复了卢梭对公民宗教的讨论，“它们必须被那些有责任实现它们的人所理解、爱和追求”(1977:7 ± 8)。

To this end, Durkheim prepared a course that was both theoretical and historical. The theory was important because it was insufficient simply to tell teachers what to do; in addition, they had to be made to understand why they were doing it ± i.e., they “must be familiar with the problems for which these prescriptions provide provisional solutions” (1977: 4). The history was important for reasons that Durkheim had given in Les Regies de la methode sociologique (1895), in his defense of the “genetic” method: “In order to fully understand the development of any living phenomenon,” Durkheim again argued, “we should need to begin by discovering the composition of the initial germ which stands at the origin of its entire evolution . . . Thus, in order to understand the way in which the educational system which we are to study has developed, in order to understand what it has become, we must not shrink from tracing it to its most remote origins.”1

为此，迪尔凯姆准备了一门既有理论又有历史的课程。这个理论很重要，因为仅仅告诉老师该做什么是不够的; 此外，他们必须明白他们为什么要这么做，也就是说，他们“必须熟悉这些处方提供临时解决方案的问题”(1977:4)。这段历史之所以重要，是因为迪尔凯姆在《社会学方法论》(Les Regies de la method socilogique，1895)中为“基因”方法辩护时提出的理由: “为了充分理解任何生命现象的发展,”迪尔凯姆再次提出，“我们应该从发现最初的细菌的组成开始，这种细菌是整个进化的起源... ... 因此，为了理解我们要研究的教育体系的发展方式，为了理解它已经变成了什么，我们必须追溯它最遥远的起源。”1

THE PREEMINENCE OF BOOKS

书籍的重要性

These “most remote origins” were both Roman and Christian, a contradictory bequest that had fateful consequences for French education.[10](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark21) [11](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark22) The Roman origins of Christianity meant that its language, culture, and social organization were irremediably pagan; and where pagan religion was a system of ritual practices without obligatory authority, Christianity was a system of ideas and a body of doctrines. “To be a Christian,” Durkheim observed, “was not a matter of carrying out certain material operations according to the traditional prescriptions, it was rather a question of adhering to certain articles of faith, of showing certain beliefs, of accepting certain ideas.” Moreover, unlike the handing down of traditional practices, the communication of Christian ideas and feelings required a distinctively Christian education, and hence the cathedral and monastery schools; but education, in turn, required a culture, and the only culture was pagan (1977: 21-2).

这些“最遥远的起源”都是罗马和基督教，一个矛盾的遗产，对法国教育产生了致命的后果。1011基督教的罗马起源意味着它的语言，文化和社会组织是无可救药的异教徒; 在异教徒宗教是一个没有义务权威的仪式实践系统，基督教是一个思想体系和教义体系。涂尔干评论道: “成为一个基督徒，并不是要按照传统的规定进行某些物质活动，而是要坚持某些信条，展示某些信仰，接受某些思想。”此外，不同于传统习俗的传承，基督教思想和感情的交流需要一个独特的基督教教育，因此，大教堂和修道院学校; 但教育，反过来，需要一种文化，唯一的文化是异教徒(1977:21-2)。

These remarks had a contemporary reference, for an argument of the laicizing movement had been that the Church had “seized” the schools in order to prevent any culture from “embarrassing the faith.” But the real truth, Durkheim insisted, was that the schools began by being the work of the Church, so that from their conception, they “were stamped with an ecclesiastical character which they subsequently had so much difficulty in erasing'' (1977: 25). Moreover, only the Church, with its pagan (materialist) past and future (idealist) orientation, could thus have served as a bridge between the Roman and Germanic societies. But if the schools thus began by being essentially religious, the pagan origins of Christianity also assured that they would contain an uneliminable element of secularity; and however feeble and rudimentary it was to begin with, Durkheim observed, this secular spirit would grow and develop. Like the aboriginal institutions described in Les Formes elementaires de la vie religieuse, “from their origins, the schools carried within themselves the germ of that great struggle between the sacred and the profane, the secular and the religious'' (1977: 25-6).

这些评论有一个当代的参考，因为教会“占领”学校是为了防止任何文化“尴尬的信仰”但涂尔干坚持认为，真正的事实是，这些学校最初是教会的工作，因此从它们的概念来看，它们“被打上了教会特征的印记，随后它们很难抹去这些特征”(1977:25)。此外，只有教会，其异教(唯物主义)过去和未来(理想主义)的取向，因此可以作为一个桥梁之间的罗马和日耳曼社会。但是，如果这些学校从本质上讲是宗教性的，那么基督教的异教起源也确保了它们包含了无法消除的世俗性因素; 而且，涂尔干观察到，无论这些学校开始时多么微弱和初级，这种世俗精神都会成长和发展。就像《 Les Formes 基本宗教生活》中描述的原住民机构一样，“从它们的起源开始，学校内部就孕育着神圣与世俗、世俗与宗教之间伟大斗争的萌芽”(1977:25-6)。

To this problematic, dichotomous legacy, Christianity added an element unknown to antiquity — the idea of conversion. In antiquity, the goal of education had been to transmit a number of speci®c talents, which might be learned from a variety of different teachers. The Greeks, for example, sought to inculcate skills that would increase the “aesthetic value'' of the individual, while the Romans stressed the “tools” people needed to perform their roles in society. Christianity, by contrast, was “a certain habitus of our moral being'' epitomized in the Christian belief in that “profound movement'' whereby “the soul in its entirety, by turning in a quite different direction, changes its position, its stance, and as a result modi®es its whole outlook on the world.'' Imbued with this idea, Christianity “developed an awareness that underlying the particular condition of our intelligence and sensibility there is in each one of us a more profound condition which determines the others and gives them their unity'' (1977: 29). Rather than decorating a man's mind with ideas or developing certain habits, Christian education became construed as a kind of gradual conversion, an attempt to act “powerfully on the deepest recesses of the soul,'' to effect the transformation of “the whole man'' (see Durkheim 1961: 109—10). This could be achieved, Durkheim observed, “only by making children live in one and the same moral environment, which is constantly present to them, which enshrouds them completely, and from whose influence they are unable, as it were, to escape'' (1977: 29). Durkheim called this “academic organicism'' — i.e., the idea that teaching must not be too diffuse, that the disparate branches of learning should be grouped together, that all should be infused by the same spirit and taught from the same point of view ± and he considered it intrinsic to Christianity itself (1977: 93).

在这个有问题的、二分法的遗产中，基督教增加了一个古代所不知道的元素ーー皈依思想。在古代，教育的目标是传递一些特殊的人才，这些人才可以从不同的教师那里学到。例如，希腊人试图灌输能够提高个人“审美价值”的技能，而罗马人则强调人们在社会中发挥作用所需的“工具”。相比之下，基督教是“我们道德存在的某种习惯”的缩影，在基督教信仰的“深刻运动”，即“整个灵魂，通过转向一个完全不同的方向，改变它的位置，它的立场，并作为结果调整其整个世界的观点。”基督教被灌输了这种思想，“发展了一种意识，在我们的智力和情感的特定条件下，我们每个人都有一种更深刻的条件，这种条件决定着其他人，并给予他们他们的统一”(1977:29)。基督教教育不是用思想装饰一个人的头脑或培养某些习惯，而是被解释为一种渐进的转变，一种“在灵魂最深处有力地行动”的尝试，以实现“整个人”的转变(见涂尔干1961:109-10)。涂尔干观察到，“只有让孩子们生活在一个同样的道德环境中，这种环境一直存在于他们身上，把他们完全包裹起来，使他们无法逃脱这种环境的影响”(1977:29)。涂尔干称之为“学术有机体”ーー也就是说，教学不能过于分散，不同的学科应该组合在一起，所有学科都应该被灌输同样的精神，从同样的角度教学，他认为这是基督教本身固有的(1977:93)。

These passages illuminate two elements of Durkheim's sociology that have frequently been ignored. The ®rst is that, for all his advocacy of secular education, Durkheim's thought, like that of Hegel (whom he occasionally, startlingly, resembles), was deeply rooted in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. For the passages, as their unconscious lapse into the present tense implies, were hardly dispassionate descriptions of a Christian “contribution” to the historical development of French education; rather, they express one of Durkheim’s most fundamental convictions concerning what French education ought to be: “. . . the principal aim [of education] is not to give the child a more or less large number of pieces of knowledge,’’ he insisted, “but to imbue in him some deep and internal state of mind, a kind of orientation of the soul which points it in a dehnite direction, not only during childhood but throughout life.’’ If the production of Christians was no longer the goal of French education, therefore, the goal of producing “whole men’’ remained the same: “Our conception of the aim has become secularized,” Durkheim acknowledged, and “consequently the means employed must also change; but the abstract outline of the educational process is not changed. It is still a question of getting down to these deep recesses in the soul about which antiquity knew nothing.’’ Like their cathedral and monastery counterparts, therefore, modern schools must provide a “morally cohesive environment,” which “closely envelops the child and which acts on his nature as a whole’’ (1977: 30).

这些段落阐明了涂尔干社会学中经常被忽视的两个要素。第一，尽管迪尔凯姆倡导世俗教育，但他的思想与黑格尔的思想(他偶尔惊人地与黑格尔相似)一样，深深扎根于犹太-基督教传统。因为，正如他们无意识地陷入现在时所暗示的那样，这些段落很难冷静地描述基督教对法国教育历史发展的“贡献”; 相反，它们表达了涂尔干关于法国教育应该是什么的最基本的信念之一: “ ... ... (教育)的主要目的不是给孩子或多或少大量的知识,”他坚称，“而是向他灌输某种深层次的内心状态，一种灵魂的方向，不仅在童年时期，而且在整个生命中，都指向一个德尼特方向。”如果生产基督徒不再是法国教育的目标，因此，生产“全人”的目标仍然是一样的: “我们的目标已经成为世俗化的概念,”涂尔干承认，“因此，采用的手段也必须改变; 但教育过程的抽象轮廓没有改变。这仍然是一个深入到灵魂深处的问题，古人对此一无所知。”因此，与大教堂和修道院一样，现代学校必须提供一个“道德上有凝聚力的环境”，这个环境“紧密地包围着孩子，并且作为一个整体对他的本性采取行动”(1977:30)。

The second element, which disappears almost entirely from stories of “Durkheim-as-child-of-the-Enlightenment,” is his palpable fascination (shared by Burke and later romantics) with the medieval period in European history. The very phrase, “the Middle Ages,’’ itself a product of the eighteenth century, was one of which Durkheim disapproved,[12](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark23) for it evinced the Enlightenment’s contemptuous and mistaken notion that the medieval period was “a mere hyphen’’ between classical antiquity and modern civilization, between “the moment when ancient civilization burned itself out and the moment when it was reborn in order to embark again upon a new career.” On the contrary, Durkheim argued, if the content of medieval education was taken from paganism, it was expounded in an entirely new way, according to an entirely new conception of the human soul; and in this sense, the medieval period “sowed the seeds of an entirely new civilization” (1977: 31).

第二个元素，几乎完全从“迪尔凯姆作为启蒙运动的孩子”的故事中消失，是他对欧洲历史中的中世纪时期明显的迷恋(伯克和后来的浪漫主义者也有同感)。这个短语“中世纪”本身就是十八世纪的产物，涂尔干对此表示反对，因为它表明了启蒙运动的轻蔑和错误观念，即中世纪时期是介于古典时代和现代文明之间的“一个连字符”，介于“古代文明自我毁灭的时刻和为了重新开始新事业而重生的时刻”之间相反，迪尔凯姆认为，如果中世纪教育的内容是从异教，它是以一种全新的方式阐述，根据一个全新的概念，人类的灵魂; 在这个意义上，中世纪时期“播下了一个全新的文明的种子”(1977:31)。

But of course these seeds required the proper soil in which to take root, and Durkheim’s account was consistently one in which social and intellectual history went hand in hand. As European society became more organized and centralized under Charlemagne, for example, its educational needs required an organized, centralized institution, the Ecole du Palais. Led by Alcuin (c. 730-804), the greatest scholar of the Carolingian Renaissance, the Ecole attracted scholars from throughout western Europe, and introduced the septem artes liberales, with its distinction between the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic) and quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music). The first was a purely formal curriculum designed to instruct the mind about the mind itself - i.e., “with general forms of reasoning, with abstractions made from their application to things, or perhaps with what is even more formal than thought, namely language.’’ By contrast, the second curriculum was comprised of “branches of learning related to things,’’ whose purpose was “to generate understanding of external realities and the laws which govern them, the laws of number, the laws of space, the laws concerning the stars, and those which govern sounds’’ (1977: 47±8).

但是，当然，这些种子需要适当的土壤才能生根，而迪尔凯姆的描述始终是社会和思想史密切相关的。例如，在查理曼大帝的领导下，欧洲社会变得更加有组织、更加集中，它的教育需求需要一个有组织、更加集中的机构——宫廷学院。由最伟大的卡洛林文艺复兴学者阿尔昆(公元730-804年)领导的学院吸引了来自整个西欧的学者，并介绍了自由艺术七部曲，区分了三部曲(语法、修辞学和辩证法)和四部曲(几何学、算术、天文学和音乐)。第一种是纯粹正式的课程设计，旨在指导思维本身-即，“与一般形式的推理，与抽象从他们的应用到事物，或者也许与什么是更正式的比思想，即语言。”相比之下，第二门课程由“与事物有关的学科”组成，其目的是“理解外部现实和支配它们的法则、数字法则、空间法则、关于恒星的法则以及那些支配声音的法则”(1977:47 ± 8)。

Again, the distinction held a contemporary resonance for Durkheim, not simply because it adumbrated the later distinction between the humanities and the sciences, but also because it reflected Durkheim’s sharp contrast between the Cartesian emphasis on idees claires et simples and the study of social facts comme des choses. For the centrality of the trivium (the “normal course of studies’’) by contrast with the supererogatory quadrivium (reserved for “a small elite of specialists”) lent the septem artes liberales an unmistakably formal and abstract character. The goal of these studies was to train the mind in large generalities and fundamental principles, Durkheim observed, regardless of how these generalities or principles might be applied; and however “vacuous, sterile, and purely mechanical” it might appear to us, Carolingian grammar thus laid the foundations for the vast, ensuing edifice of medieval logic, the distinctive contribution of Christianity to Western thought (1977: 62).

同样，这种区别对涂尔干具有当代的共鸣，不仅仅是因为它预示了后来人文学科和科学学科之间的区别，而且也因为它反映了涂尔干在笛卡尔主义强调思想清晰和简单和研究社会事实即事物之间的鲜明对比。因为三部曲(“正常的学习过程”)的中心性与超级四部曲(保留给“一小群专家精英”)形成了鲜明的对比，使得自由主义的七部曲具有明确的形式和抽象特征。涂尔干观察到，这些研究的目的是训练头脑中的大概论和基本原则，不管这些概论或原则如何应用; 无论在我们看来是多么“空洞、乏味和纯粹的机械”，加洛林语法因此为中世纪逻辑的巨大建筑奠定了基础，基督教对西方思想的独特贡献(1977:62)。

The University of Paris, far from being the achievement of Abelard (1079—1142), enjoyed a similarly sociological explanation (Durkheim 1977: 76—7). The Crusades called for by Pope Urban II (c. 1042—99) unified European society and stimulated geographic mobility, and the early 12th-century consolidation of the Capetian monarchy made the cathedral and monastery schools of Paris increasingly attractive to mendicant scholars. By the end of the century, the demand for education far outstripped anything the Church could provide, and individual teachers were necessarily authorized to open schools in their own homes, outside of the cathedrals and monasteries. There was soon a large population of both teachers and pupils operating outside of any ecclesiastical atmosphere, subject to only indirect and remote regulation by the Church. The reader familiar with book 2 of De la division du travail social will recognize Durkheim’s prototypical explanation (drawn from Darwin) for evolutionary social change — an increase of population volume and density leading to conflict, competition, differentiation and, ultimately, the emergence of new forms of social organization (Durkheim 1984: 208—17; 1977: 78—9).

巴黎大学，远非阿贝拉尔(1079ー1142)的成就，享有类似的社会学解释(涂尔干1977:76ー7)。教皇乌尔班二世(1042-99)号召的十字军东征统一了欧洲社会，刺激了地域流动性，12世纪早期对开普敦君主制的巩固使得巴黎的大教堂和修道院学校对乞丐学者越来越有吸引力。到本世纪末，对教育的需求远远超过了教会所能提供的一切，个别教师必须被授权在他们自己的家里，在大教堂和修道院之外开办学校。不久，就有大批教师和学生在任何教会气氛之外活动，只受教会间接和遥远的管制。熟悉《社会劳动分工》第二卷的读者会认识到涂尔干对进化的社会变化的典型解释(出自达尔文) : 人口数量和密度的增加导致冲突、竞争、分化，最终导致新的社会组织形式的出现(涂尔干1984:208ー17; 1977:78ー9)。

The reader familiar with the Preface to the second edition of the same work, not to mention the conclusion of Le Suicide, will also recognize Durkheim’s focus on corporate groups (Durkheim 1933: 411—35; 1951: 78—92). The medieval corporations had emerged when workers in the same occupation formed associations to secure their legal rights. These associations then became monopolies, as workers tried to restrict the rights thus secured to their own group; but each association also imposed duties and obligations on its members and, if these were not met, removed their rights and privileges. The teachers operating outside of the French ecclesiastical structure organized themselves as such a corporation — i.e., the university of Paris — and their unity was increased further when the Pope, acknowledging the university’s international character, placed it under the protection of the Holy See (1977: 85).

熟悉同一作品第二版序言的读者，更不用说《自杀》的结论，也会认识到涂尔干对企业集团的关注(涂尔干1933:411ー35; 1951:78ー92)。当同一职业的工人组成协会以确保他们的合法权利时，中世纪的公司就出现了。这些协会后来成为垄断企业，因为工人们试图限制由此保障给自己群体的权利; 但每个协会也对其成员强加义务和义务，如果这些义务和义务得不到履行，就剥夺他们的权利和特权。在法国教会结构之外运作的教师组成了这样一个公司ーー即巴黎大学ーー他们的团结进一步加强，当教皇承认该大学的国际性质，将其置于罗马教廷的保护之下(1977:85)。

This observation was important, for Durkheim was arguing, not simply that the European universities were international in their origins, but also that they could become “narrowly nationalistic” in the present only by betraying their “essential nature.’’ The “renaissance” of the French universities in the late 19th century, he added, had been precisely an attempt to open them to “foreign students and teachers,’’ to “multiply the opportunities for looking at the world from a different conceptual point of view,” and to become “centers of international civilization” (1977: 86). As we shall see in chapter 4 (especially pp. 185±207), it is difficult to read this passage without thinking that German experimental science was at the top of Durkheim’s list of “different conceptual point[s] of view.” French nationalism as well as the “old” rationalism of Descartes were twin obstacles, mutually and repeatedly indicted in Durkheim’s program for social and educational reform.

涂尔干认为，这一观点很重要，不仅仅是因为欧洲大学的起源是国际性的，而且因为它们只有通过背叛其“本质”才能在当下变得“狭隘的民族主义”他补充说，19世纪末法国大学的“复兴”，正是试图向“外国学生和教师”开放，“增加从不同观念角度看世界的机会”，并成为“国际文明的中心”(1977:86)。正如我们将在第四章(特别是第185 ± 207页)中看到的，如果不想到德国实验科学在涂尔干的“不同的概念观点”列表中位居首位，就很难读懂这段文字法国民族主义和笛卡尔的“旧”理性主义是一对障碍，在涂尔干的社会和教育改革计划中相互和反复地指责。

Durkheim recognized that the medieval corporations, once established and recognized, almost immediately developed a resistance to change, an unresponsiveness to the new needs of their environments; and the university was no exception. The evolution of education, Durkheim explained to his students, “always lags very substantially behind the general evolution of society as a whole. We shall encounter new ideas spreading throughout the whole of society without palpably affecting the university corporation, without modifying either its course of study or its methods of teaching’’ (1977: 163±4). As we shall see, the particular “new ideas’’ with which Durkheim was concerned were those of experimental science, introduced by Galileo and Bacon in the early 17th century, but penetrating the walls of the university only two centuries later. But it would be a mistake to think that Durkheim’s assessment of the corporatist structure of the medieval universities was wholly negative. On the contrary, he regarded this form of social organization, with its combination of unity and diversity, as the single greatest contribution of the Middle Ages to French education (1977: 161±2).

涂尔干认识到，中世纪的公司，一旦建立和承认，几乎立即发展了抵制变化，对新的需要，他们的环境无反应; 大学也不例外。涂尔干向他的学生解释说，教育的进化“总是严重滞后于整个社会的总体进化。我们将会遇到遍及整个社会的新思想，而不会明显地影响到大学公司，不会改变它的学习过程或教学方法”(1977:163 ± 4)。正如我们将要看到的，涂尔干所关注的那些特殊的“新思想”是那些实验科学，由伽利略和培根在17世纪早期引进，但仅仅两个世纪后就穿透了大学的墙壁。但是，如果认为涂尔干对中世纪大学的社团主义结构的评价完全是负面的，那就大错特错了。相反，他认为这种结合了统一性和多样性的社会组织形式是中世纪对法国教育的最大贡献(1977:161 ± 2)。

Durkheim’s interpenetration of social and intellectual history is nowhere more evident than in his account of Scholastic philosophy. Given its peculiar origins, the medieval university of the Scholastic period was both an ecclesiastical and a secular body, composed of laymen who retained their clerical appearance, and clerics who had become secularized. As a consequence, religion and philosophy, faith and reason were scarcely differentiated. “It was not a question of juxtaposing reason and doctrine,’’ Durkheim explained, “but rather of introducing reason into doctrine, of rendering faith rational’’ (1977: 96). The 17th century’s liberation of secular from spiritual studies had thus been purchased at an exorbitant price ± i.e., a wholly artificial dissociation of sacred from profane, a “thoroughly mediocre kind of eclecticism,” and a “lamentable restriction” on the university’s field of operations. “How much more interesting,” Durkheim challenged his audience,

涂尔干对社会和知识分子历史的相互渗透在他对经院哲学的解释中最为明显。考虑到其特殊的起源，经院时期的中世纪大学既是一个教会组织，也是一个世俗组织，由保持其教士形象的外行人和已经世俗化的神职人员组成。因此，宗教和哲学、信仰和理性几乎没有区别。涂尔干解释说: 「这不是将理性与教义并列的问题，而是将理性引入教义，使信仰理性化。」(1977:96)。因此，17世纪将世俗从精神研究中解放出来的努力付出了高昂的代价，也就是说，将神圣与世俗完全人为地分离开来，实行“彻底平庸的折衷主义”，并对大学的运作领域实行“可悲的限制”。“多么有趣啊,”涂尔干挑战他的听众,

was the age which we are presently studying, when no one was yet trying to separate these inseparable aspects of human life, when no one had yet attempted to channel and to build a dam between these two great intellectual and moral streams as if it were possible to prevent them from running into one another! How much more vital was this general, tumultuous melee of beliefs and feelings of every kind than the state of calm, which was artificial and only apparent, which was characteristic of succeeding centuries! (1977: 96—7)

是我们现在所研究的时代，当时还没有人试图分离人类生活的这些不可分割的方面，当时还没有人试图在这两个伟大的知识和道德流之间建立一个大坝，好像有可能阻止它们相互碰撞！这种各种各样的信仰和感情的普遍的、混乱的混战，比那种人为的、只有表面的、以后几个世纪的特征为特征的平静状态，要重要得多！(1977:96ー7)

Durkheim’s “man of the future’’ thus bore an uncanny resemblance to a man of the past — neither the bourgeois of the Enlightenment nor the aristocrat of the ancien regime, but the lay-cleric of medieval Scholasticism. His intentions were thus reconstructive, an attempt to reproduce that medieval unity of “religion and philosophy, faith and reason’’ which preceded the 17th century. The significant qualification was that the religion, like Rousseau’s, had to be civil, and the faith, like Kant’s, quintessentially moral.

涂尔干的“未来之人”因此与过去的人有着惊人的相似之处ーー既不是启蒙运动的资产阶级，也不是古代政权的贵族，而是中世纪经院哲学的外行牧师。因此，他的意图是重建，试图重现17世纪之前中世纪“宗教与哲学、信仰与理性”的统一。重要的限定是，宗教，像卢梭的，必须是文明的，而信仰，像康德的，典型的道德。

An equally favorable judgment (and one equally ill fitted to the notion of Durkheim as heir of the Enlightenment) is rendered on the specific content of the Scholastic teachings. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Durkheim observed, education was less a question of learning certain truths than one of learning what certain authorities said about them. Study thus dealt, not with lists of problems, but with lists of works, the latter being subjected to the exegetic method, including both expositio (i.e., the dialectical analysis of the text in the effort to reveal the necessary connections between its propositions) and quaestiones (i.e., the extraction of all the controversial propositions from the text, which then provided the pretext for debate). The purpose of such exercises, Durkheim pointed out, was to train students in dialectic, which meant that the role of logic in medieval education was extremely important. Moreover, it was logic of a special kind: “It was far less a question of teaching people how to reason,’’ Durkheim explained, “than of teaching them how to debate. What was taught above all was the art of arguing against another person, the art of refutation even more than the art of proof’’ (1977: 141).

一个同样有利的判断(一个同样不适合迪尔凯姆作为启蒙运动的继承人的概念)是对经院哲学的具体内容作出的。涂尔干观察到，在13和14世纪，教育与其说是一个学习某些真理的问题，不如说是一个学习某些权威人士如何评价这些真理的问题。因此，研究不是处理问题列表，而是处理作品列表，后者受到解经法的制约，包括阐释(即，为了揭示文本命题之间的必要联系而对文本进行辩证分析)和提问(即，从文本中提取所有有争议的命题，然后提供辩论的借口)。涂尔干指出，这些练习的目的是训练学生辩证法，这意味着逻辑在中世纪教育中的作用是极其重要的。此外，这是一种特殊的逻辑: “这远不是教人们如何推理的问题,”迪尔凯姆解释说，“而是教他们如何辩论的问题。最重要的是学会了与他人争论的艺术，驳斥的艺术甚至超过了证明的艺术”(1977:141)。

It was precisely this emphasis on exegesis, dialectic, and debate which left Scholasticism vulnerable to the derisive criticisms of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. But here again Durkheim ap-

正是这种对训诂学、辩证法和辩论的强调，使得经院哲学在文艺复兴和启蒙运动的嘲讽批评面前显得脆弱不堪。但这里又是涂尔干

peared as a defender of Scholastic thought and practice rather than as an Enlightenment critic: “the way in which a principle may thus be abused,'' he argued, “in no wise proves that the principle is unsound, for the principle may be a very good one, capable of producing a bene®cial effect even if some people operate it clumsily or to excess.'' But did this emphasis on debate serve any purpose? Durkheim had a typically Burkean argument for suspecting that it did: “ . . . the very fact that [the Scholastic practice of debate] played so important a role in European education for nearly three centuries scarcely justihes the historian in supposing that it was simply the monumental educational aberration which the pundits of the Renaissance believed it to be.''[13](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark24)

作为学者派思想和实践的捍卫者，而不是启蒙运动的批评者: “一个原则可能因此被滥用的方式,”他认为，“无论如何都不能证明这个原则是不健全的，因为这个原则可能是一个非常好的原则，能够产生有益的效果，即使有些人操作得很笨拙或过度。”但这种强调辩论的做法有什么意义吗？迪尔凯姆有一个典型的伯克式观点，认为它确实如此: “ ... ... (学院派辩论的实践)在近三个世纪的欧洲教育中扮演了如此重要的角色，这一事实几乎证明，历史学家认为，这只是文艺复兴时期的专家们所认为的不可思议的教育失常。”。“13

To identify this distinctive function of debate, Durkheim turned to his favorite classical author, and virtually the only philosopher before Comenius and Montesquieu whom he truly admired. Aristotle, Durkheim observed, had constructed a theory about the art of debate “to which the Middle Ages added nothing of essential importance” (1977: 143; see also Challenger 1994). Indeed, its contribution to the social organization of the university notwithstanding, the medieval period had contributed nothing to the creation of new knowledge, simply borrowing what had already been achieved by the Greeks and especially Aristotle (Durkheim 1977: 164). According to Aristotle, therefore, true learning takes place only when one can demonstrate the existence of necessary connections (i.e., connections of such irresistible cogency that no intelligent being can deny them without self-contradiction). Such demonstrations are made by showing that the terms of a proposition include some “property” or “constituent part'' which necessarily implies some other term, and thus forms a unity with it; and the supreme example of such propositions are those of mathematics, which Aristotle thus regarded as the model for all scientihc demonstration.

为了识别辩论的这种独特功能，迪尔凯姆求助于他最喜爱的古典作家，也是夸美纽斯和孟德斯鸠之前他真正钦佩的唯一哲学家。涂尔干观察到，亚里士多德建立了一个关于辩论艺术的理论，“中世纪对此没有增加任何本质上的重要性”(1977:143; 参见《挑战者》1994)。事实上，尽管它对大学的社会组织做出了贡献，但中世纪时期对新知识的创造没有任何贡献，只是借鉴了希腊人，特别是亚里士多德已经取得的成就(涂尔干1977:164)。因此，根据亚里士多德的观点，真正的学习只有当一个人能够证明必要联系的存在时才会发生(也就是说，如此不可抗拒的联系，以至于没有一个聪明的人能够不自相矛盾地否认它们)。这样的论证是通过表明一个命题的术语包括一些“属性”或“组成部分”，这必然意味着一些其他术语，从而与它形成一个统一体; 这样的命题的最高例子是数学的那些，亚里士多德因此认为是所有科学论证的模型。

Durkheim fully agreed with Aristotle on the exemplary role of mathematics with regard to the demonstration of necessary connections, for mathematical concepts are simple, possess few properties, comprise a limited number of constituent elements and are, in any case, human constructs (1977: 144). But in ethics, Durkheim argued, not even entertaining the older rationalism of Kant, connections can be established only through observation and induction, neither capable of yielding necessary connections. But, fortunately, there remained an alternative form of demonstrative argument ± in place of the particular concept we wish to analyze, we substitute other concepts related to the original. We then verify propositions respecting these concepts, and retrospectively apply these propositions to the original. This extension of more general propositions to particular cases, Durkheim admitted, could yield only “plausible,” and never “absolutely compelling,” propositions of its own. But at least these propositions have a good chance of being true, and thus there are good — if not decisive — reasons for believing them. Inevitably, of course, this procedure yields a variety of propositions which are both equally plausible and logically incompatible. Confronted with this situation, Durkheim argued that we must never accept any argument on the basis of the reasons adduced in its support alone; rather, we must compare each proposition (and its associated arguments) with every other — in short, we must debate.

迪尔凯姆完全同意亚里士多德关于数学在证明必要联系方面的示范作用，因为数学概念是简单的，具有很少的属性，包含有限数量的组成要素，并且在任何情况下都是人类构造(1977:144)。但是在伦理学中，涂尔干认为，甚至连康德的旧理性主义都不能接受，联系只能通过观察和归纳来建立，而且两者都不能产生必要的联系。但是，幸运的是，在我们想要分析的特定概念中，仍然存在另一种形式的证明论证，我们用与原始概念相关的其他概念来代替。然后，我们验证关于这些概念的命题，并回顾性地将这些命题应用到原文中。迪尔凯姆承认，这种将更一般的命题扩展到特定情况的做法，只能产生“似是而非的”命题，而且永远不会产生“绝对令人信服的”命题。但至少这些命题很有可能是正确的，因此有充分的理由(如果不是决定性的)相信它们。当然，这个过程不可避免地产生了各种各样的命题，这些命题同样似是而非，在逻辑上也是不相容的。面对这种情况，迪尔凯姆认为，我们绝不能仅仅基于支持论点的理由而接受任何论点; 相反，我们必须将每个命题(及其相关论点)与其他命题进行比较ーー简而言之，我们必须进行辩论。

This was Durkheim’s account of what Aristotle had done in the Nicomachean Ethics, a work which Durkheim had taught regularly at Bordeaux after 1888:

这是迪尔凯姆对亚里士多德在《尼各马可伦理学》中所做工作的描述。1888年以后，迪尔凯姆定期在波尔多讲授这部作品:

whenever Aristotle confronts a problem he imposes upon himself as a strict methodological rule to assemble and examine the different solutions which his predecessors had given to this problem, so that he could set them beside his own, so that he could examine them simultaneously, in other words so that he could debate them. Indeed he often thinks up his own objections to his thesis. And he debates with imaginary adversaries.[14](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark25)

每当亚里士多德面对一个问题时，他就把自己作为一个严格的方法论规则来汇集和检验他的前辈们对这个问题给出的不同解决方案，这样他就可以把它们放在自己的问题旁边，这样他就可以同时检验它们，换句话说，这样他就可以对它们进行辩论。事实上，他经常对自己的论点提出反对意见。他还与想象中的对手辩论。14

This is a passable account of Durkheim’s own dialectical method, used wherever the evidence ran short, and particularly in his characteristic “argument by elimination” (Lukes 1972: 31—3). But most importantly, it is Durkheim’s answer to the question of the real value of debate to scholars of the Middle Ages. Far from being the way to knowledge, Durkheim insisted that dialectic and debate were introduced at precisely the point where knowledge, in any strict sense, was seen to be impossible: “There was no question of making debate a substitute for proof,'' Durkheim argued, “but rather of setting debate beside proof in that area where strict proof had not as yet penetrated” (1977: 147). And in the Middle Ages, the range of impenetrability was immeasurably large, for the idea of experimental science did not yet exist.

这是对迪尔凯姆自己的辩证法的一个可以接受的描述，在证据不足的地方使用，特别是在他特有的“排除论证”中(卢克斯1972:31ー3)。但最重要的是，这是迪尔凯姆对中世纪学者辩论的真正价值问题的回答。迪尔凯姆坚持认为，辩证法和辩论的引入恰恰是在认为知识在任何严格意义上都是不可能的时候: “辩论并不是证据的替代品,”迪尔凯姆认为，“而是在严格证据尚未渗透的领域将辩论置于证据之外。”(1977:147)。在中世纪，因为实验科学的概念还不存在，所以不可穿透的范围是无法测量的。

This was the most important point of Durkheim's entire discussion of the Scholastic period, for it revealed what was, to him, the critical, decisive difference between his age and theirs ± the Scholastic focus on books in sharp contrast to the modern focus on things. The Scholastics knew what observation was, Durkheim acknowledged, but they did not know that observation could be organized and transformed in such a way as to furnish the elements of a rule-governed demonstrative proof. The idea of experimental reasoning ± that well-conducted, systematic observations might be combined to prove scienti®c laws ± was to be the distinctive contribution of Galileo; and the idea that this form of reasoning was a sui generis logical operation, a new method of proof, would emerge only with Bacon. In its absence, scienti®c proof was quite naturally regarded as synonymous with mathematical proof, and the enormous realm of experience, about which only “plausible” propositions were assumed possible, was left subject to the dialectical method. During the medieval period, therefore, knowing how to think consisted in knowing how to debate (1977: 152).

这是涂尔干对经院哲学时期的整个讨论中最重要的一点，因为对他来说，这揭示了他的年龄和他们的经院哲学对书籍的关注之间的关键性的、决定性的区别，与现代对事物的关注形成了鲜明的对比。涂尔干承认，经院哲学家们知道观察是什么，但他们不知道观察可以被组织和转化，以便提供规则管理的证明要素。实验推理的想法，即良好的，系统的观察可以结合起来证明科学定律 ± 是伽利略的独特贡献; 这种形式的推理是一种独特的逻辑操作，一种新的证明方法的想法，只会出现在培根。在没有科学证明的情况下，科学 C 证明很自然地被认为是数学证明的同义词，而只有“似是而非”的命题才被假定为可能的庞大经验领域则被置于辩证法之下。因此，在中世纪时期，知道如何思考在于知道如何辩论(1977:152)。

To be able to debate, of course, one had to be familiar with the full variety of arguments, and thus with the texts within which these arguments were contained. The almost superstitious respect which the Scholastics showed toward books was thus the consequence not of their believing that these books contained demonstrable truths, but rather of the view that they contained resources which might be useful in the dialectical pursuit of “merely plausible” propositions. In short, Durkheim concluded that the cult of the book was the product of specihc historical conditions, “the necessary consequence of a certain view of science which was forced upon the age'' (1977: 153). Here again, Durkheim's treatment of past ideas scarcely concealed his present purposes. His whole point was to show that the Scholastic emphasis on dialectic was the natural consequence of specihc historical causes; and since, by the late 19th century, these causes no longer existed ± i.e., we are aware of the nature and value of experimental reasoning — the argument that the study of books should be preeminent loses, and should lose, all credibility, to be replaced by the study of things: “Today we know that there is an alternative method of proof, a different mode of argument,” Durkheim observed, “and it is now no less essential that we inculcate this mode of argument in our children than it was necessary to teach the scholars of the Middle Ages the art of dialectic.”[15](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark26)

当然，为了能够进行辩论，人们必须熟悉各种各样的论点，因此也必须熟悉包含这些论点的文本。因此，经院哲学家对书籍表现出的近乎迷信的尊重，不是因为他们相信这些书包含可证明的真理，而是因为他们认为这些书包含的资源可能有助于辩证地追求“仅仅似是而非”的命题。简而言之，迪尔凯姆得出结论，对该书的崇拜是特定历史条件的产物，是“强加于时代的某种科学观的必然结果”(1977:153)。在这里，涂尔干对过去思想的处理几乎没有掩盖他现在的目的。他的全部观点是要表明，学院派对辩证法的强调是特定历史原因的自然结果; 因为，到19世纪后期，这些原因不再存在，也就是说，我们意识到了实验推理的性质和价值ーー认为对书籍的研究应该是卓越的失败，应该失去所有的可信度，取而代之的是对事物的研究: “今天，我们知道有一种替代的证明方法，一种不同的论证模式,”涂尔干观察到，“现在，我们向我们的孩子灌输这种论证模式的重要性，并不亚于有必要向中世纪的学者们传授辩证法的艺术。”15

Durkheim’s notion that the study of experimental reasoning should thus replace dialectic in the public schools was not entirely unqualified, for he understood that even the natural sciences “still do not cover and will never cover some more or less substantial portions of reality, for the simple reason that they are incapable of exhausting it.’’ Where experimental science provides no clear answers, we must still be capable of action, and thus of some sort of reasoned reflection; and here, Durkheim insisted, “we must proceed as best we can by means of analogies, comparisons, generalizations, suppositions: in a word, by using dialectic’’ (1977: 154—5). Since the propositions we reach by this kind of reasoning could never be more than plausible, it necessarily gives rise to controversy, and this was nowhere more true than in that particular realm of nature dealt with by the social sciences, where the application of experimental reasoning had barely begun, and where the study of books as well as things was still justified (1977: 155). But there can be no doubt that Durkheim’s vision of the future of social science was one in which the former was steadfastly and increasingly replaced by the latter.

涂尔干认为实验推理的研究应该取代公立学校的辩证法，这一观点并非完全没有资格，因为他明白，即使是自然科学“仍然没有覆盖，也永远不会覆盖现实的一些或多或少的实质性部分，原因很简单，他们无法耗尽它。”在实验科学没有提供明确答案的地方，我们仍然必须有能力采取行动，从而进行某种理性的反思; 在这里，涂尔干坚持认为，“我们必须通过类比、比较、概括和假设尽可能地进行下去: 一句话，通过使用辩证法”(1977:154ー5)。由于我们通过这种推理所得到的命题永远不会超过似是而非的，它必然会引起争议，而且在社会科学处理的自然领域中，这是最真实的，在那里实验推理的应用才刚刚开始，对书籍和事物的研究仍然是合理的(1977:155)。但毫无疑问，迪尔凯姆对社会科学未来的展望是，前者正在被后者坚定地、并且越来越多地取代。

THE PREEMINENCE OF STYLE

风格的卓越

The term “Renaissance” is ordinarily used to designate that cultural movement that began in Italy with the rise of Petrarch (1304—74), spread throughout the rest of Europe, and concluded sometime near the end of the 16th century. Its essential features are often described as a renewed concentration on the world of nature and of man, in sharp contrast with the “darkness” of the Middle Ages; and its principle cause, according to this view, was the rediscovery of the literary masterpieces of antiquity. Like the word itself, this conception of the Renaissance was a product of the French Enlightenment. And just as he had quarreled with the Enlightenment's understanding of medieval Scholasticism, Durkheim found its interpretation of the nature and causes of the Renaissance sociologically incoherent.

“文艺复兴”一词通常被用来指意大利的文化运动，它始于彼得拉克(1304-74)的崛起，传播到欧洲其他地区，并在16世纪末结束。它的基本特征经常被描述为对自然界和人类世界的重新集中，与中世纪的“黑暗”形成鲜明对比; 根据这种观点，它的主要原因是重新发现了古代的文学杰作。就像这个词本身一样，文艺复兴的概念是法国启蒙运动的产物。正如他与启蒙运动对中世纪经院哲学的理解争论不休一样，涂尔干发现启蒙运动对文艺复兴的本质和起因的解释在社会学上是不连贯的。

Durkheim's initial objection, for example, simply rephrased his argument against the Enlightenment notion of the Middle Ages as “a mere hyphen'' between ancient and modern societies. The notion that humanity “strayed from its natural path for hfteen centuries,'' he observed, “is historically incredible” (1977: 167). Durkheim's second objection was drawn directly from the opening pages of La Cite antique (1864), where Fustel de Coulanges had argued against the French revolutionary's tendency to hnd their models in Roman civilization (1977: 168; Fustel 1956: 11). Like Fustel, Durkheim considered the Enlightenment resurrection of Rome as the model for its political and social reforms historically anachronistic. And third, Durkheim insisted that it was simply not true that classical literature was “unknown” during the Middle Ages: “There was not a single period during the whole of the Middle Ages,'' he insisted, “when these literary masterpieces were not known; in every generation we ®nd a few people suf®ciently intelligent and sensitive to be able to appreciate their work . . . the scholars of the Middle Ages knew about all the main aspects of classical civilization, but only retained what they regarded as important, what answered to their own personal needs'' (1977: 168). In short, it was the medieval preoccupation with logic, not ignorance of the classical sources, which dehned the special character of Scholasticism.

例如，涂尔干最初的反对意见，只是将他反对启蒙运动中世纪观念的论点改写为古代社会和现代社会之间的“一个连字符”。他指出，人类“在15个世纪里偏离了自然的道路”的观点“在历史上是不可思议的”(1977:167)。涂尔干的第二个反对意见直接来自于《古城》(1864)的开篇，努马-丹尼斯·甫斯特尔·德·库朗日反对法国革命者在罗马文明中推销他们的模型的倾向(1977:168; 福斯特尔1956:11)。与福斯特尔一样，涂尔干认为启蒙运动对罗马的复兴是其政治和社会改革的典范，在历史上是不合时宜的。第三，迪尔凯姆坚持认为，古典文学在中世纪“不为人所知”的说法是不正确的: “在整个中世纪，没有一个时期是不为人所知的,”他坚持认为，“每一代人中，我们和少数足够聪明和敏感的人能够欣赏他们的作品... ... 中世纪的学者知道古典文明的所有主要方面，但只保留他们认为重要的东西，那些符合他们个人需要的东西”(1977:168)。简而言之，正是中世纪对逻辑的专注，而不是对经典来源的无知，凸显了经院哲学的特殊性。

The distinctive feature of the Renaissance, therefore, was the decline of this preoccupation with logic, and the rise of a more rehned, elegant, literary culture; and its preoccupation with classical literature was the consequence not of its “re-discovery,” but rather of the need to satisfy these new, more rehned tastes. The problem of explaining the Renaissance thus resolved itself into one of accounting for the rise of these new tastes; and, predictably, Durkheim argued that they were the consequence of “profound changes in the organization of European societies'' (1977: 169). The primary economic causes were the growth of population, the rise of towns, the discovery of new trade routes and, most importantly, the rise of a bourgeoisie with new ambitions, expectations, and aspirations; and the most signihcant political cause was the rise of the European nation states, with their shattering of the moral and intellectual unity of Christianity, and the ascetic ideal that it represented. While people continued to profess respect for the fundamental doctrines of the Church, therefore, each of these new groups had “its own special mode of thought and feeling,” its particular “temperament” whose emphasis subverted more traditional beliefs. Soon these groups proclaimed their right of schism and free inquiry in the Reformation, “the natural result of the movement towards individualism and differentiation which was taking place at that time amongst the homogeneous mass of Europe” (1977: 171).

因此，文艺复兴的区辨特征在于，这种对逻辑的专注的衰落，以及一种更高贵、优雅、文学文化的兴起，它对古典文学的专注不是其“重新发现”的结果，而是满足这些新的、更高贵的品味的需要。因此，解释文艺复兴的问题就变成了解释这些新品味兴起的问题。可以预见的是，迪尔凯姆认为，这些新品味是“欧洲社会组织的深刻变化”(1977:169)的结果。主要的经济原因是人口的增长，城镇的兴起，新贸易路线的发现，最重要的是，资产阶级的兴起，他们有了新的野心、期望和抱负; 最重要的政治原因是欧洲民族国家的兴起，他们粉碎了基督教的道德和知识统一，以及它所代表的禁欲主义理想。虽然人们继续表示尊重教会的基本教义，因此，每一个新的团体都有“自己特殊的思想和感情模式”，其特殊的“气质”，其重点颠覆了更多的传统信仰。不久，这些团体宣布他们的权利分裂和自由探索的宗教改革，“运动的个人主义和分化的自然结果，这是发生在同质的大众之间的欧洲”(1977:171)。

As these economic and political causes altered the social organization of western Europe, they literally created a demand for a new kind of human being, and hence for a new kind of education: “instruction designed to produce a good bachelor of arts initiated into all the secrets of syllogism and of argument,” Durkheim noted, “would be quite unsuited to the enterprise of producing an elegant and fluent nobleman who was capable of holding his own in a salon and who possessed all the social graces” (1977: 172, 200-5). The Renaissance criticism of medieval education was thus epitomized in words like barbarus, stoliditas, rusticitas. The Scholastic teacher was not simply wrong; he was quite literally a barbarian, ignorant of all the benefits of civilization. If the primary contribution of the Middle Ages to education had been its form of social organization, therefore, the primary contribution of the Renaissance was to be its educational ideal, one by which the French would live until at least the mid-19th century.[16](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark27) Moreover, while earlier changes in educational thought had resulted from the gradual, unreflective development of grammatical and then logical formalism, the Renaissance would break with this unconscious tradition altogether, introducing an efflorescence of genuinely theoretical educational literature (1977: 179).

由于这些经济和政治原因改变了西欧的社会组织，他们确实创造了对一种新的人类的需求，因此也创造了一种新的教育: “旨在培养一个良好的哲学硕士的教学开始进入所有的三段论和论证的秘密,”涂尔干指出，“将是相当不适合的企业生产一个优雅和流利的贵族谁能够举行自己的沙龙和谁拥有所有的社会风度”(1977:172,200-5)。因此，文艺复兴时期对中世纪教育的批判集中体现在诸如“巴巴罗斯”、“斯托利迪塔斯”、“乡村”这样的词汇上。学者派的老师不仅仅是错误的，他简直就是一个野蛮人，对文明的一切好处一无所知。如果中世纪对教育的主要贡献是其社会组织形式，那么，文艺复兴的主要贡献就是其教育理想，法国人至少可以通过这种理想生活到19世纪中叶。此外，虽然早期教育思想的变化是由于语法形式主义和逻辑形式主义的渐进、不加思考的发展，但文艺复兴将完全打破这种无意识的传统，引入真正的理论教育文学的繁荣(1977:179)。

For Durkheim, the two major currents of theoretical opinion in the Renaissance were represented by Rabelais (c. 1494-c. 1553) and Erasmus (1466—1536). The dominant idea of all Rabelais’ works was a horror of any obstacle to the free generation of human activity: “Everything which hampers, everything which restricts the desires, the needs, the passions of man,’’ Durkheim summarized, “is an evil. His ideal is a society where nature, liberated from all restraint, can develop in complete freedom” (1977: 181). The preconception underlying this idea was that nature, including those needs typically regarded as vulgar and base, is good simply because it is natural; and the view of man underlying this preconception was one of unlimited, unrealized potential. Above all else, the realization of this “true life” required knowledge; and this requirement in turn yielded a theory of education — one which emphasized not selected branches of knowledge, but knowledge in its entirety. Like his contemporaries, Rabelais gave highest priority to the study of ancient languages and literature; but for Rabelais, this study was not to make the student a literary sophisticate, but to provide concrete knowledge of facts, of “what the ancients thought and said about nature and about themselves, about things and about their lives” (1977: 186). The book remained preeminent, for Rabelais’ focus was still on what the ancients said about “things” rather than things themselves; and this confusion of books and things would become the characteristic feature of Renaissance science. Moreover, the Renaissance would continue to pursue knowledge as an end in itself, without any thought to its pragmatic value. But “what a transformation,” Durkheim exclaimed, “what a revolution has taken place!’’:

对于涂尔干来说，文艺复兴时期的两股主要理论思潮是由拉伯雷(1494-c。和伊拉斯谟(1466-1536)。拉伯雷所有作品的主导思想是对任何阻碍人类活动自由发展的障碍的恐惧: “任何阻碍、任何限制人的欲望、需求和激情的东西,”涂尔干总结道，“都是邪恶的。他的理想是一个社会，在这个社会里，自然从所有的束缚中解放出来，可以在完全的自由中发展”(1977:181)。这种先入为主的观点认为，自然，包括那些通常被认为是庸俗和基础的需要，是好的，仅仅因为它是自然的; 而这种先入为主的观点背后的人的观点是一种无限的、未实现的潜力。最重要的是，实现这种“真正的生活”需要知识，而这一要求反过来又产生了一种教育理论ーー这种理论强调的不是知识的选择性分支，而是知识的整体性。和他的同时代人一样，拉伯雷对古代语言和文学的研究给予了最高的优先权; 但是对于拉伯雷来说，这项研究并不是要让学生成为一个文学高手，而是要提供关于事实的具体知识，关于“古人对自然和他们自己，对事物和他们的生活的想法和说法”(1977:186)。这本书仍然是杰出的，因为拉伯雷的重点仍然是古人所说的“事物”，而不是事物本身; 这种书和事物的混淆将成为文艺复兴科学的特征。此外，文艺复兴将继续追求知识本身作为一个目的，没有任何思想的实用价值。但是“多么大的变化啊,”涂尔干惊呼道，“多么大的革命啊!”:

Something quite different is being sought for in the book: beyond the book, behind it, one can just see emerging, however timidly and uncertainly, the Thing . . . Here at last there appears for the first time the idea of a new kind of curriculum whose object will be not to train the mind in formal intellectual acrobatics, but rather to nourish it, to enrich it, to give it some substance. (1977: 187)

这本书正在寻找一些完全不同的东西: 在书本之外，在它的背后，人们可以看到正在出现的东西，无论多么胆怯和不确定... ... 这里终于首次出现了一种新课程的想法，其目的将不是在正式的智力杂技训练头脑，而是滋养它，丰富它，给它一些实质内容。(1977:187)

With Rabelais and the Renaissance, therefore, we see for the first time the idea that would epitomize Durkheim’s view of science, education, and social realism — the preeminence of things over ideas, of the newer over the older rationalism, of induction over deduction, of experiment over logic.

因此，在拉伯雷和文艺复兴时期，我们第一次看到了代表涂尔干的科学、教育和社会现实主义观点的思想ーー事物优于思想、新事物优于旧理性主义、归纳优于演绎、实验优于逻辑。

At first glance, Erasmus seems to have been imbued with the same thirst for knowledge, and to have imposed the same polymathic demands upon the Renaissance teacher; but in Erasmus, Durkheim discovered, this breadth of knowledge was required, not that it might be transmitted to the students, but rather that they might be relieved of it. Students were required to know only the best classical authors

乍看之下，伊拉斯谟似乎被灌输了同样的求知欲，并对文艺复兴时期的老师施加了同样的博学要求，但在 Erasmus，迪尔凯姆发现，这种知识的广度是必要的，不是它可能被传递给学生，而是他们可能被释放。学生被要求只认识最好的古典作家
 
- — Lucian, Demosthenes, Herodotus, Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides, Terence, Plautus, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, Caesar, and Sallust

    卢西安、德摩斯梯尼、希罗多德、阿里斯托芬、荷马、欧里庇得斯、特伦斯、普劳图斯、维吉尔、贺拉斯、西塞罗、凯撒和萨鲁斯特 - — a list which, in Durkheim’s opinion, was not terribly long. But this merely reflected Erasmus’ conception of the purpose of education, which was the pursuit of knowledge, not as an end in itself, but as a tool for the development of the orationis facultas — the art of speaking or writing. The only way to teach students to write in a pure, elegant style was to immerse them in the great literary works of antiquity; and this in turn explained Erasmus’ preoccupation with the study of Greek and Latin, as well as his brief, discriminating list of authors who wrote in those languages (1977: 193-6). About to be delivered from educational formalism by Rabelais, Durkheim observed, we are re-subjected to a new, literary formalism by Erasmus.

    在涂尔干看来，这份名单并不长。但这仅仅反映了伊拉斯谟的教育目的的概念，即追求知识本身不是目的，而是作为发展演说的工具，即说话或写作的艺术。教学生用纯粹、优雅的风格写作的唯一方法是让他们沉浸在古代伟大的文学作品中; 这反过来解释了伊拉斯谟对希腊语和拉丁语的专注，以及他简短、有区别的用这些语言写作的作家名单(1977:193-6)。迪尔凯姆注意到，即将从拉伯雷的教育形式主义中解放出来的我们，正在重新受制于伊拉斯谟的一种新的文学形式主义。

Durkheim’s contempt for this educational ideal — with its academic exercises, competitions, and prizes, its appeal to the child’s sense of honor and taste for praise — was increased by his sense that it still survived in the secondary schools of the Third Republic (1977: 196). The resulting indictment was simultaneously social and moral. Socially, the Renaissance preoccupation with elegance and style clearly reflected the needs and interests of a leisured class — or those who, like the rising bourgeois of the Second Empire, aspired to it — and a concomitant ignorance of and indifference to that larger mass of people whose material, moral, and intellectual conditions would have been improved by a very different kind of education. “In order to struggle effectively in the world of persons and the world of things,’’ Durkheim explained, “more substantial weapons are needed than those glittering decorations with which the humanist educationalists were concerned to adorn the mind to the exclusion of anything else.’’ In fact, for this “world of persons and things,’’ the Scholastic emphasis on dialectic and debate had provided far superior weapons (1977: 206—7).

迪尔凯姆对这种教育理想的蔑视——包括它的学术练习、竞赛和奖励，它对孩子荣誉感和赞美品味的吸引力——因为他感到这种理想仍然存在于第三共和国的中学(1977:196)而加剧。由此产生的起诉既是社会的，也是道德的。从社会角度来看，文艺复兴时期对优雅和风格的关注，清楚地反映了一个悠闲阶层的需求和兴趣ーー或者那些像第二帝国崛起的资产阶级一样渴望休闲的阶层ーー以及随之而来的对更多人的无知和漠视，这些人的物质、道德和智力条件本可以通过一种非常不同的教育得到改善。迪尔凯姆解释说: “为了在人和事物的世界中有效地进行斗争，我们需要更多实质性的武器，而不是那些人文主义教育家所关心的用来装饰头脑而排斥其他任何东西的闪闪发光的装饰品。”事实上，对于这个“人与物的世界”，经院哲学对辩证法和辩论的强调已经提供了更好的武器(1977:206ー7)。

Morally, the educational ideal of the Renaissance provided an occasion for Durkheim’s oft-repeated, puritanical insistence that aesthetic values breed immorality. “Any culture which is exclusively or essentially aesthetic,’’ he argued, “contains within itself a germ of immorality, or at least of inferior morality.’’ The basis for this claim seems to have been that deep respect for the morality of simple, unrefined peoples, and concomitant suspicion of the ethics of literate, bourgeois society, which Durkheim shared with Rousseau, and which appears quite powerfully in his treatment of anomic suicide (see chapter 5, pp. 268—90). Art, by definition, is preoccupied with the unreal and the imaginary, while morality concerns itself with action and reality. Here again, therefore, Durkheim affirmed the preeminence of things. But above all — and here again the debt to Rousseau and Kant is palpable — Durkheim felt that the Renaissance attempt to revive the ethics of antiquity had passed over the single, most important consequence of the intervening centuries — the Christian idea of duty.

在道德上，文艺复兴时期的教育理想为涂尔干反复强调的审美价值观滋生不道德提供了契机。“任何纯粹或本质上是审美的文化,”他认为，“其本身就含有一种不道德的萌芽，或者至少是劣等道德的萌芽。”这种说法的基础似乎是对简单、粗俗民族的道德的深深尊重，以及对有文化的、资产阶级社会的道德的同时产生的怀疑，涂尔干和卢梭都有这种怀疑，这种怀疑在他对无规则自杀的处理中表现得相当有力(见第5章，第268-90页)。根据定义，艺术专注于虚幻和不真实，而道德则关注行动和现实。因此，涂尔干在这里再次肯定了事物的卓越性。但最重要的是，涂尔干认为，文艺复兴时期试图复兴古代伦理学的努力，已经超越了中间几个世纪唯一最重要的后果——基督教的责任观念。

In fact, for all his admiration of Aristotle, Durkheim’s assessment of pagan ethics, particularly in light of the austere, Protestant morality he inherited from Kant, was always rather negative. The Greeks and Romans had “a very vague and flimsy notion of [duty],’’ and regarded morality as “a seductive ideal which is inherently attractive and which spontaneously gives direction to the will of anyone who has managed to see it clearly.’’ All pagan ethics, Durkheim objected, “even the most sublime, even those of the Stoics, were derived from the eudaemonic ethics which they were never able to shake off’’ (1977: 209). In sharp contrast, the Christian idea — seemingly paraphrased from Kant’s Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason (1793) — was that “all considerations of personal happiness were banished,’’ because they “could only serve to corrode and diminish the moral value of our actions.’’ The Christian ethic is “to do one’s duty because it is one’s duty, to obey the rules because they are the rules’’ (Durkheim 1977: 209). The disastrous consequence of the Renaissance ideal was that the child was forced to live in both moral environments simultaneously, making him a “moral hybrid, divided against himself, torn between the present and the past and enfeebled by the conflict’’ (1977: 210).

事实上，尽管迪尔凯姆钦佩亚里士多德，但他对异教伦理的评价，尤其是考虑到他从康德那里继承来的，简朴的新教伦理，总是相当消极的。希腊人和罗马人有“一个非常模糊和脆弱的[责任]的概念”，并认为道德是“一个诱人的理想，它本质上是有吸引力的，它自发地指导任何人的意志，谁已经设法看清楚。”涂尔干反对说，所有的异教伦理，“即使是最崇高的，即使是斯多葛学派的，都源于他们永远无法摆脱的幸福伦理”(1977:209)。与此形成鲜明对比的是，基督教的观点——似乎是从康德的《纯粹理性范围内的宗教》(1793年)中解释出来的——是“所有对个人幸福的考虑都被放逐了”，因为它们“只会腐蚀和削弱我们行为的道德价值”基督教的伦理是“做一个人的责任，因为它是一个人的责任，服从规则，因为他们是规则”(涂尔干1977:209)。文艺复兴理想的灾难性后果是，这个孩子被迫同时生活在两种道德环境中，使他成为“道德混合体，与自己分裂，在现在和过去之间被撕裂，被冲突削弱”(1977:210)。

Durkheim thus endorsed the Scholastic view that pagan education led to internal conflict, confusion, and the corruption of moral agency. And for similar reasons, he preferred the Rabelaisian quest for encyclopaedic knowledge to the “narrowly egotistical’’ pursuit of praise represented by Erasmian humanism. But above all, he admired Rabelais’ elevation of things over ideas; for to understand things one must “step outside oneself and out of the internal world of images in which the pure man of letters delights’’ (1977: 212). This preference for “the real world’’ of things was not simply a theoretical whim; on the contrary, it was above all a practical, moral matter. For Durkheim repeatedly insisted that an immersion in the world of things not only provided a more accurate, complete conception of nature. More importantly, it provided man with a better sense of his place within it, and thus opposed his natural, destructive tendency to egoism: “by comparing himself with the immense universe surrounding him,” Durkheim explained, “he understands that he is not the whole of it but only a small part. He no longer runs the risk of thinking of himself as the centre to which everything must be related; rather he perceives that he belongs to a system which goes in®nitely beyond him and which has its centre outside him” (1977: 212—13). In short, Durkheim embraced the 17th-century view of science later reconstructed and anatomized by Robert Merton, the view that the practice of science (’’dealings with things”) was an essentially moral and even redemptive activity; and it was for these practical, moral bene®ts that he encouraged its introduction in French secondary education.

因此，迪尔凯姆赞同学者的观点，认为异教徒的教育导致内部冲突，混乱，腐败的道德机构。出于类似的原因，他更喜欢拉伯雷式对百科全书知识的追求，而不是以伊拉斯米人文主义为代表的“狭隘的自我主义”对赞美的追求。但最重要的是，他欣赏拉伯雷对事物的超越观念的提升; 因为要理解事物，就必须“走出自己，走出纯粹的文人所喜爱的内在形象世界”(1977:212)。这种对事物的“真实世界”的偏好不仅仅是理论上的一时兴起; 相反，它首先是一个实际的、道德的问题。因为涂尔干一再坚持认为，沉浸在事物的世界中不仅提供了一个更准确、更完整的自然概念。更重要的是，它提供了一个更好的感觉，他在其中的位置，从而反对他的自然，破坏性倾向的利己主义: “通过比较自己与周围的广阔宇宙,”涂尔干解释说，“他明白，他不是整体，但只是一小部分。他不再冒险认为自己是所有事物都必须联系起来的中心; 相反，他认为自己属于一个系统，这个系统远远超出了他的范围，而且它的中心在他之外。”(1977:212-13)。简而言之，涂尔干接受了后来罗伯特 · 默顿重建和解剖的17世纪的科学观，认为实践科学(“与事物打交道”)本质上是一种道德甚至是救赎性的活动; 正是由于这些实用的道德优点，他鼓励将其引入法国中等教育。

Durkheim’s admiration for Rabelais should not be exaggerated. If he admired Rabelais’ recognition of the preeminence of things — or at least what books said about things — he simultaneously deplored his ignorance of the practical value of their study. Approached as an end in itself, as knowledge for its own sake, Durkheim insisted, science was diverted from its true purpose, which was the amelioration of the human condition; and this left it vulnerable to an evil still more repugnant than Erasmian humanism — the skepticism of Michel de Montaigne (1533—92). With his practical mind and common sense, Montaigne in fact disdained the literary education of the humanists no less than Durkheim; but Montaigne considered a scienti®c education equally useless. Like Rabelais, he failed to see any ameliorative role science might play; and with his view of the mind as a “natural” entity, independent of the knowledge it held, he denied any formative role to scienti®c education as well. For Montaigne, in short, the only worthwhile education was a practical education — i.e., one acquired from life itself rather than teachers and schools. Here, Durkheim observed, Montaigne had identi®ed the greatest vice of Renaissance educational theory. For its most serious question, raised and then begged by both Rabelais and Erasmus, was how these ideas, conceived on behalf of a would-be aristocracy and extolling purely aesthetic values, would fare when confronted with the harsh world of real things. “Such is the serious practical problem,’’ Durkheim observed, “which the sixteenth century had to resolve, and upon whose resolution the intellectual and moral future of our country was to depend’’ (1977: 225—6). This resolution was the signi®cant contribution of the Society of Jesus.

不应夸大涂尔干对拉伯雷的钦佩。如果他钦佩拉伯雷对事物卓越性的认识，或者至少是书中对事物的描述，那么他同时也痛惜自己对书中研究的实用价值的无知。迪尔凯姆坚持认为，科学本身就是一种目的，就像为了自己的目的而获得知识一样，它偏离了真正的目的，即改善人类的状况，这使得它容易受到一种比伊拉斯米人文主义(1533-92)更加令人厌恶的邪恶的伤害，即对米歇尔·德·蒙泰涅的怀疑主义。蒙田用他的实用主义思想和常识，实际上和涂尔干一样鄙视人文主义者的文学教育，但是蒙田认为科学教育同样是无用的。像拉伯雷一样，他没有看到科学可能发挥的任何改善作用; 他认为心灵是一个“自然”的实体，独立于它所拥有的知识，他也否认科学教育的任何形成作用。简而言之，对蒙田来说，唯一有价值的教育是实践教育ーー即从生活本身而非教师和学校中获得的教育。在这里，涂尔干注意到，蒙田发现了文艺复兴时期教育理论的最大缺点。拉伯雷和伊拉斯谟提出并恳求的最严肃的问题是，当面对现实世界的残酷时，这些代表潜在的贵族和赞美纯粹美学价值观的想法将如何表现。涂尔干说: “这就是十六世纪必须解决的严重的实际问题，我们国家的知识和道德未来将依赖于这个问题的解决”(1977:225ー6)。这个决议是耶稣会的重大贡献。

Durkheim’s assessment of the place of the Jesuits in the history of educational thought was both complex and — considering Durkheim’s role in the laicizing policies of the Third Republic — shockingly appreciative. It began with three observations. First — and here the Jesuits combined two elements which their medieval antecedents had considered irreconcilable — they belonged to a religious order while simultaneously retaining the characteristics of the secular priesthood. That is, although subject to a severe communal discipline, they remained “in the world.’’ Second, seeing that to guide their age they would have to assimilate its spirit, the Jesuits combined the strictest personal orthodoxy with an indulgence toward the ideas and tastes of their opponents. And third, recognizing that the most illustrious minds of the day had become converted to humanism, and that the people would thus be subject to an entirely pagan form of learning, the Jesuits saw that to preach, to hear confession, and to catechize was no longer enough; on the contrary, “the really important instrument in the struggle for mastery of the human soul was the education of the young. Thus,'' Durkheim summarized, “they resolved to seize hold of it’’ (1977: 233—4).

涂尔干对耶稣会士在教育思想史上的地位的评价既复杂又令人震惊地赞赏ーー考虑到涂尔干在第三共和国的政策中所扮演的角色。它开始于三个观察。首先ーー在这里，耶稣会士结合了他们中世纪的祖先认为不可调和的两个要素ーー他们属于一个宗教秩序，同时保留了世俗祭司的特征。也就是说，尽管受到严格的公共纪律约束，他们仍然“在世界上”其次，耶稣会士认为，为了引导他们的时代，他们必须吸收其精神，他们将最严格的个人正统观念与对对手的思想和品味的纵容结合起来。第三，耶稣会认识到当时最杰出的思想已经转变为人文主义，因此人们将受到一种完全异教的学习形式的影响，耶稣会认识到仅仅布道、听忏悔和教诲已经不够了; 相反，“在掌握人类灵魂的斗争中，真正重要的工具是对年轻人的教育。因此,”涂尔干总结道，“他们决心抓住它”(1977:233ー4)。

This should not be mistaken as the grudging admiration of a fair-minded laicizer for his worthy adversaries. On the contrary, the tone of the passages is unmistakably one of admiration tout court. From the first weeks of his course, Durkheim had been telling a story — the story of a gradual process of secularization whereby French education, emerging from the shadows of Church and monastery, had become progressively freed of ecclesiastical controls. But education had also lost sight of its goal of producing “whole men,’’ the “morally cohesive environment” essential to this purpose, and the unity of reason and faith found among the Scholastics. French education was also increasingly literary, aesthetic, and totally unconcerned with the needs of real people, tendencies which culminated with Erasmus’ emphasis on style and the skepticism of Montaigne. With the Jesuits, however, the centre of academic life was once again transported into the hands of a religious order. Running directly counter, not simply to Renaissance theories, but to the entire trend of educational thought, the remarkable thing was not that the Jesuits were opposed. Rather, it was that they succeeded.

这不应该被误解为一个公正的连环杀手对其可敬的对手的勉强的赞赏。相反，这些段落的基调无疑是一种公开的赞美。从他上课的头几个星期开始，涂尔干就一直在讲述一个故事——一个世俗化的渐进过程，从教堂和修道院的阴影中走出来的法国教育逐渐摆脱了教会的控制。但是，教育也忽视了其培养“全人”的目标，忽视了这一目标所必需的“道德凝聚环境”，忽视了经院哲学家之间理性与信仰的统一。法国的教育也越来越文学化、美学化，完全不关心现实生活中人们的需要，这种趋势在伊拉斯谟强调风格和蒙田的怀疑主义中达到了顶峰。然而，随着耶稣会士的到来，学术生活的中心又一次转移到了宗教秩序的手中。不仅与文艺复兴时期的理论，而且与整个教育思潮背道而驰，值得注意的并不是耶稣会的反对。相反，他们成功了。

How, then, did they succeed? Not because the education they offered was free, Durkheim insisted, and not because the subjects they taught were different from those taught by the university. Yet the education offered by the Jesuits differed from that available at the university in two significant respects, and in both, it looked more to the future than to the past. First, while the university teachers felt that they had re-discovered Christian morality in pagan civilization, the Jesuits had a clear sense of the distance which separated antiquity from the 16th century, “the one thoroughly impregnated with the eudaemonistic ethic, the other steeped in the contrary principle; the one regarding happiness as another aspect of virtue, however this might be conceived, the other sanctifying and glorifying suffering” (1977: 255). Acknowledging this distance, the Jesuit interpretation of Greco-Roman antiquity deliberately excluded everything specifically Greek or Roman, substituting an idealized, ahistorical civilization in which individuals were reduced to symbols of Christian virtues and vices — Achilles representing courage, Ulysses wily prudence, Numa the archetype of piety, Caesar the man of ambition, and so on. These general, unspecific “types” could then be used to exemplify the precepts of Christian morality, a project advanced by the almost complete absence of historical science in the Jesuit colleges.

那么，他们是如何成功的呢？涂尔干坚称，这并不是因为他们提供的教育是免费的，也不是因为他们所教授的课程与大学所教授的课程不同。然而，耶稣会提供的教育在两个重要方面不同于大学提供的教育，而且在这两个方面，耶稣会更多地着眼于未来而不是过去。首先，虽然大学老师们认为他们在异教文明中重新发现了基督教的道德，但耶稣会教徒对于古代与16世纪之间的距离有一个清晰的认识，“一个完全浸透了幸福论的道德，另一个浸透了相反的原则; 一个把幸福视为美德的另一个方面，无论这个方面如何构想，另一个使苦难成圣和荣耀”(1977:255)。耶稣会对古希腊-罗马文明的解释承认了这种距离，故意排除了一切特别是希腊或罗马的东西，取而代之的是一种理想化的、非历史的文明，在这种文明中，个人被贬低为基督教美德和罪恶的象征——阿喀琉斯代表勇气，尤利西斯狡猾的谨慎，努马代表虔诚，凯撒代表雄心勃勃，等等。这些一般的，不具体的“类型”，然后可以用来例证基督教道德的戒律，一个项目提出的几乎完全缺乏历史科学在耶稣会学院。

Second, and more important, the disciplinary structure of Jesuit education departed signi®cantly from its university counterpart by introducing two new principles. The first was that “there could be no good education without contact which was at once continuous and personal between the pupil and the educator” (1977: 258—9). This served a double purpose: ®rst, by subjecting the student to constant scrutiny, it reduced the possibility of misconduct or spiritual backsliding; and second, it rendered Jesuit education more personal, and therefore better suited to the personality of the individual student. At first glance, this principle resembles that “academic organicism” which Durkheim had so admired in the education of the Middle Ages: “The child’s environment followed him wherever he went,’’ he noted approvingly, “all around him he heard the same ideas and the same sentiments being expressed with the same authority. He could never lose sight of them. He knew of no others.’’ But it soon becomes clear that Durkheim considered Jesuit discipline far superior to that of the Scholastics, not because it was more “organic,” but because it acknowledged that “education is essentially an individual matter’’ (1977: 259—60).

其次，也是更为重要的一点，耶稣会教育的学科结构通过引入两条新的原则而明显地脱离了大学教育。第一个是“没有学生和教育者之间持续和个人的接触，就不可能有好的教育”(1977:258ー9)。这样做有两个目的: 第一，通过让学生接受持续的审查，它减少了不当行为或精神倒退的可能性; 第二，它使耶稣会教育更加个人化，因此更适合个别学生的个性。乍一看，这个原则类似于涂尔干在中世纪的教育中十分推崇的“学术有机体”: “孩子的环境跟随着他，无论他走到哪里,”他赞许地注意到，“他周围的人用同样的权威表达同样的思想和情感。他永远不会忘记他们。他不知道还有其他人。”但是很快就清楚了，涂尔干认为耶稣会的纪律远远优于经院哲学家的纪律，不是因为它更“有机”，而是因为它承认“教育本质上是一个个体问题”(1977:259-60)。

A similar acceptance of individualism marked the second principle of Jesuit discipline — the view that learning could be advanced through competition for prizes. Here again Durkheim emphasized the break with medieval tradition. In the Middle Ages, competition had been almost unknown, examinations largely a formality, and rewards or prizes nonexistent. The Jesuit introduction of competitive examinations and prizes, combined with the careful, relentless supervision to which students were subjected, thus conspired to introduce a new spirit of willful, individualistic achievement: “Everything,” Durkheim summarized, “was inducing them to exert themselves. As a result within the Jesuit colleges there was genuinely intensive activity, which was no doubt flawed by being expended on the superficial rather than on the profound, but whose existence was incontestable” (1977: 261-2).

对个人主义的类似接受标志着耶稣会纪律的第二个原则ーー即通过竞争获得奖励可以促进学习的观点。这里涂尔干再次强调了与中世纪传统的决裂。在中世纪，竞争几乎是不为人知的，考试在很大程度上只是一种形式，奖励或奖品是不存在的。耶稣会对竞争性考试和奖励的引入，加上学生所受到的严格、无情的监督，因此共同引入了一种新的任性、个人主义的成就精神: “一切,”迪尔凯姆总结道，“都在诱导他们努力奋斗。因此，在耶稣会学院内部，存在着真正密集的活动，毫无疑问，这些活动是有缺陷的，因为它们被花费在表面而不是深刻的东西上，但是它们的存在是无可争议的”(1977:261-2)。

Not surprisingly, Durkheim considered this egoistic academic organization blatantly immoral, a vulgar appeal to the egotistical sentiments of the individual. But the explanation for this efflorescence of individualism was not to be found within Jesuit educational thought, nor even within the Renaissance education generally. For, as always, Durkheim considered these principles and theories as mere reflections of more fundamental changes in the “moral constitution of society,” changes which, in the 16th and 17th centuries, had led to the emergence of the individual personality as a major force in Western history. The increased personal contact between student and instructor in Jesuit education thus responded to the needs of an increasingly heterogeneous student body; and the stimulus of competition and reward recognized that, “in proportion as each individual has his own particular moral life, he must be moved by considerations which are speci®cally appropriate to him'' (1977: 264). In short, the moral organization of the school had always to reflect that of civil society, and as consciousness became more individualized, education had to follow suit.

毫不奇怪，迪尔凯姆认为这种自私自利的学术组织公然不道德，是对个人自私情绪的粗俗诉求。但是这种个人主义的兴盛并不能在耶稣会教育思想中找到解释，甚至在文艺复兴时期的教育中也找不到。因为，一如既往，迪尔凯姆认为这些原则和理论仅仅反映了“社会道德结构”的更根本性的变化，这些变化在16和17世纪导致了个人人格作为西方历史的主要力量的出现。耶稣会教育中学生和老师之间增加的个人接触因此响应了日益多样化的学生群体的需要; 竞争和奖励的刺激认识到，“按照每个人都有自己特定的道德生活的比例，他必须被特别适合他的考虑所感动”(1977:264)。总之，学校的道德组织必须始终反映公民社会的道德组织，随着意识的个性化，教育也必须跟随。

Nevertheless, Durkheim considered Renaissance education a powerful but negative influence on the French character. Arguing against the view that humanist education had inhibited the flowering of the French language, he insisted that the study of ancient languages had produced several of the most distinctive traits of the national intellect — e.g., its taste for generalized and impersonal types (epitomized in the classical French drama of the 17th century), its tendency to abstraction and simpli®cation, and its resulting, constitutional optimism: “When one is thoroughly imbued with the belief that things are simple or reducible to simple components,'' Durkheim explained, “one also believes that everything is clear or can be translated into clear terms. Thus reason is sheltered from bouts of despair, and refuses to concede that reality contains anything which is irreducibly obscure and unintelligible and over which, consequently, it can have no dominion'' (1977: 276).

然而，涂尔干认为文艺复兴时期的教育对法国人的性格产生了强大而负面的影响。他反驳了人文主义教育抑制了法语繁荣的观点，坚持认为对古代语言的研究已经产生了一些民族智慧的最显著的特征，例如，它对广义和非人格类型的喜好(在17世纪的古典法国戏剧中集中体现) ，它的抽象和简化的倾向，以及由此产生的宪法乐观主义: “当一个人完全被灌输相信事物是简单的或者可以简化为简单的组成部分,”迪尔凯姆解释说，“一个人也相信一切都是清晰的或者可以翻译成清晰的术语。这样，理性就避免了一阵阵的绝望，并且拒绝承认现实包含了任何无法还原的晦涩和难以理解的东西，因此，它不能支配任何东西”(1977:276)。

Durkheim's estimate of this sheltered, optimistic reason was extremely critical. This “mathematical mentality,'' this spirit of “extreme over-simplification,'' he grumbled, encourages us “to deny all reality to anything which is too complex to be contained within the meagre categories of our understanding” (1977: 275). And this lamentable feature of the national intellect reached its apogee just one century later, in the work of Descartes. In Cartesian philosophy, Durkheim complained, we see “that universal mathematics, the systematic elaboration of the French urge for simplification.'' For Descartes there is “nothing real about physical bodies apart from uniform, homogeneous, geometrical extension''; and in the individuality of things, he sees “mere appearances, tricks of light and shade, lacking in consistency and in reality, just as he makes the whole of consciousness consist in abstract and impersonal thought alone'' (1977: 275). Through Descartes, the same mentality passed into the 18th century, resulting in the abstract individualism and disregard for historical context that epitomized the Enlightenment. This state of mind, Durkheim complained, grounded on “the illusion that the complex is a mere appearance,” inflicted upon the French “a kind of intellectual blindness with regard to one whole area of reality'' (1977: 276).

涂尔干对这种受到保护的乐观理由的估计是极其关键的。这种“数学心态”，这种“极端简单化”的精神，他抱怨道，鼓励我们“否定所有现实，否定任何太复杂而不能包含在我们所理解的贫乏范畴中的事物”(1977:275)。仅仅一个世纪之后，笛卡尔的著作中，民族智慧的这一可悲特征就达到了顶峰。迪尔凯姆抱怨说，在笛卡尔哲学中，我们看到“普遍的数学，系统地阐述了法国人对简化的渴望。”对笛卡尔来说，“除了统一的、同质的、几何的延伸外，物理身体没有什么真实的东西”; 在事物的个性中，他看到“仅仅是表象、光影的把戏，缺乏一致性和现实性，正如他使整个意识仅仅存在于抽象和非个人化的思想中”(1977:275)。通过笛卡尔，同样的心态传入了18世纪，导致了抽象的个人主义和对历史背景的漠视，成为启蒙运动的缩影。涂尔干抱怨说，这种精神状态是基于“错觉，认为情结只是一种表象”，强加给法国人“一种对整个现实领域的智力盲点”(1977:276)。

Despite these criticisms of Renaissance thought and its Cartesian consequences, Durkheim believed that the “philosophy of clear ideas'' would (and should) remain the basis of the French mentality. To do so, however, it would have to be reformed: “Reason must acquire suf®cient strength to retain its con®dence in itself while at the same time being aware that things are complex and that their complexity is real'' (1977: 276). These reforms — this “new rationalism” in which things, not books or style, were preeminent — had begun by the end of the Enlightenment. And it had begun in Germany.

尽管这些批评文艺复兴思想及其笛卡尔式的后果，涂尔干认为，“哲学的清晰思想”将(并应该)仍然是法国心态的基础。然而，要做到这一点，就必须对它进行改革: “理性必须获得足够的力量来保持对自身的信心，同时意识到事物是复杂的，它们的复杂性是真实的”(1977:276)。这些改革ーー这种“新理性主义”是在启蒙运动结束时开始的，在这种改革中，出类拔萃的是事物，而不是书籍或风格。而且是从德国开始的。

THE PREEMINENCE OF THINGS

事物的显著性

From Carolingian grammar, through Scholastic logic, and down to the literary style of Renaissance, Durkheim's constant theme in L'Evolution pedagogique en France was the persistence of what he called “educational formalism” — the study of man rather than nature: “Things were not intrinsically interesting,” he complained, “they were not the object of a special study carried out for its own sake, but were only dealt with in connection with the human beliefs to which they had given rise. What people wanted to know about was not how the real world actually is but rather what human beings had said about it” (1977: 279). Durkheim was particularly concerned that his audience understand that this preoccupation was an utterly contingent product of specihc social and historical circumstances. The pre-Socratics, for example, had no such predilection, concentrating almost exclusively on the physical universe rather than its human inhabitants; and this was because the ancient Greeks considered nature itself to be sacred — a belief reflected in the ritualistic aspect of pagan religion (1977: 281—2).

从加洛林语法，经过学院派逻辑，到文艺复兴时期的文学风格，涂尔干在《法国进化教育学》中的永恒主题是他所谓的“教育形式主义”的坚持，即对人而不是自然的研究: “事物本身并不有趣,”他抱怨道，“它们不是为了自身的目的而进行的特殊研究的对象，而只是与它们所产生的人类信仰联系在一起。人们想知道的不是现实世界究竟是怎样的，而是人类对现实世界的看法”(1977:279)。涂尔干特别关注的是，他的听众明白，这种专注完全是特定社会和历史环境的偶然产物。例如，前苏格拉底时代就没有这种偏好，他们几乎完全专注于物质世界，而不是人类居民; 这是因为古希腊人认为自然本身是神圣的——这种信仰反映在异教宗教的仪式方面(1977:281ー2)。

With Christianity, however, this sacred quality passed from nature to the human soul — itself an emanation of the divine — while ritual practice gave way to spiritual contemplation. Christianity thus encouraged the individual to look within himself, to examine and reflect upon his conscience. For Durkheim, as for Fustel, therefore, Christianity marked the bifurcation of the world into sacred and profane — into thought, consciousness, morality, and religion, on the one hand, and mindless, amoral, nonreligious matter on the other. The primitive unity of nature — conceived as both sacred and profane — was lost. And since, by such a view, the supreme goal of education could only be the perfection of the human soul, the study of the profane world, of matter, of things, fell into disrepute.

然而，在基督教中，这种神圣的品质从自然传递到人类的灵魂ーー它本身就是神性的发散ーー而礼仪实践让位于精神沉思。基督教因此鼓励个人审视自己，审视和反省自己的良心。因此，对于涂尔干和福斯特来说，基督教标志着世界分裂为神圣和世俗ーー一方面是思想、意识、道德和宗教，另一方面是没有头脑、不道德和非宗教的事物。自然界的原始统一ーー被认为是神圣的和世俗的ーー已经失去了。由于这种观点认为，教育的最高目标只能是人类灵魂的完善，因此，对世俗世界、物质、事物的研究就变得声名狼藉。

How was this Christian resistance to education concerning the things of this world to be overcome? Thus posed, Durkheim’s problem was not unlike that set by Max Weber in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism — i.e., of transcending that “economic traditionalism’’ which left agricultural workers indifferent to the principles of rational pro®t making. For Durkheim, as for Weber, resistance could be overcome only by showing that temporal, secular, and profane things had some higher value; and for Durkheim, as for Weber, this was the special contribution of the Protestant Reformation. Protestantism, Durkheim insisted, “had a feeling for secular society and its temporal interests which Catholicism neither possessed nor could possess.’’ Luther himself was “fundamentally tepid’’ toward humanism, and in the Protestant countries of Germany, the Renaissance preeminence of style “never exercised the same influence and the same authority as it did with us. From the end of the sixteenth century its influence and prestige were declining” (1977: 285—6). With the Lutheran Reformation, therefore, “the ground was prepared for the emergence of a new educational theory which, by contrast with humanism, would seek in the world of things, in the world of reality, the tools of intellectual culture” (1977: 286).

如何克服基督徒对关于这个世界的事物的教育的抵制？因此，迪尔凯姆的问题与马克斯•韦伯(Max Weber)在新教伦理与资本主义精神中提出的问题没有什么不同ーー即，超越那种让农业工人对理性保护原则漠不关心的“经济传统主义”。对涂尔干和韦伯来说，只有证明世俗的、世俗的和世俗的东西有更高的价值，才能克服反抗; 对涂尔干和韦伯来说，这是宗教改革的特殊贡献。涂尔干坚持认为，新教“对世俗社会及其世俗利益有一种感情，而天主教既不拥有也不能拥有这种感情。”路德本人对人文主义“从根本上来说是不温不火的”，在德国的新教国家，文艺复兴时期风格的卓越“从来没有像它对我们那样施加过同样的影响和权威。从十六世纪末开始，它的影响力和威望都在下降”(1977:285ー6)。因此，随着路德宗的改革，“一种新的教育理论的出现，与人文主义相反，将在事物的世界中，在现实的世界中，寻求知识文化的工具”(1977:286)。

This new educational theory was called realism, and while sometimes traced to the attacks on classical learning found in the works of Rabelais and Montaigne, the origins of the movement are more commonly found in De Tradendis Disciplinis (1531), a work of the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives (1492 — 1540) which recognized the limitations of Aristotelian logic and metaphysics, recommended state support for education, urged the study of nature as well as books, supported education for all classes and both sexes, and praised the inductive over the deductive method (Monroe 1900: 16—24). Similar emphases on induction, on the direct, close, and personal contact with nature, and on state-supported education are of course to be found in the works of Francis Bacon (1561 — 1626), where they were conjoined with that Puritan context indirectly acknowledged by Durkheim and later explored by Robert Merton. In fact, Durkheim repeatedly evinced an admiration for Baconian inductivism which, in a French rationalist, might be considered unusual.[17](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark28) But Durkheim emphasized not simply the Protestant, but the German Protestant origins of educational realism; and though not German himself, the most important influence on the development of German realism was the Moravian educational theorist Jan Amos Komensky, or Comenius (1592—1670).

这种新的教育理论被称为现实主义，虽然有时可以追溯到拉伯雷和蒙田的著作中对古典学习的攻击，但这场运动的起源更常见于西班牙人文主义者胡安 · 路易斯 · 维夫斯(Juan Luis Vives，1492-1540)的《纪律》(1531) ，该书承认亚里士多德逻辑和形而上学的局限性，建议国家支持教育，鼓励对自然和书籍的研究，支持所有阶层和男女的教育，并赞扬归纳法胜过演绎法(门罗1900:16-24)。在弗朗西斯 · 培根(Francis Bacon，1561-1626)的著作中，我们当然可以找到类似的对归纳法、对直接、亲密和个人与自然的接触以及对国家支持的教育的强调，他们与涂尔干间接承认的、后来由罗伯特 · 默顿探索的清教背景相结合。事实上，涂尔干一再表现出对培根归纳主义的崇拜，这在法国理性主义者看来可能是不寻常的。但是涂尔干不仅强调新教徒，而且强调德国新教教育现实主义的起源; 虽然不是德国人自己，但对德国现实主义发展最重要的影响是摩拉维亚教育理论家扬 · 阿莫斯 · 科门斯基(Jan Amos Komensky) ，或夸美纽斯(1592-1670)。

Comenius was born in Nivnitz, Moravia on March 28, 1592. Both of his parents were influential members of the Moravian Brethren, the religious organization that descended directly from the Bohemian reformer and martyr, John Huss (c. 1372 — 1415). Orphaned at 12, his early schooling was deficient, and he entered the Latin school at Prerau only at the relatively advanced age of 16. Precisely because he was older than his classmates, however, he quickly discerned that their lack of progress was due less to their own limitations than to those of the methods by which they were taught. Discouraged by Utraquist hostility from attending the university of Prague, Come-nius studied Protestant theology at the German universities of Herborn and Heidelberg, returning to Fulneck, Moravia shortly before the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War (1618—48). When the Catholic Hapsburgs invaded Bohemia and defeated the Protestant forces, Comenius became a permanent exile. Finding refuge with a Moravian prince in Poland, he rapidly produced three major works in the history of educational thought — the Janua Linguarum (1631), the Great Didactic (1632), and the School of Infancy (1633) — simultaneously applying these theories to practices in the local gymnasium. Both the writings and the reforms quickly granted Comenius an international reputation, and in the summer of 1641 he came to England at the special invitation of Parliament.

夸美纽斯于1592年3月28日出生于摩拉维亚的 Nivnitz。他的父母都是摩拉维亚兄弟会有影响力的成员，摩拉维亚兄弟会是一个宗教组织，直接从波西米亚改革者和烈士约翰 · 赫斯(约1372-1415)的后裔。他12岁成为孤儿，早期学校教育不足，16岁时才进入 Prerau 的拉丁学校学习。然而，正因为他比同学年长，他很快就意识到，他们缺乏进步与其说是因为他们自身的局限性，不如说是因为他们被教授的方法。出于对乌特拉奎斯特教派的敌意，克莱纽斯没有上布拉格大学，他在德国的黑博恩大学和海德保大学学习新教神学，在三十年战争(1618-48)爆发前不久返回 Fulneck 的摩拉维亚。当天主教哈布斯堡王朝入侵波希米亚并打败了新教势力时，夸美纽斯成了永久的流亡者。他在波兰找到了一位摩拉维亚王子的庇护，迅速创作了教育思想史上的三部重要著作: 《亚努阿语言集》(1631年)、《大说教集》(1632年)和《幼儿学校》(1633年) ，同时将这些理论应用于当地体育馆的实践。这些著作和改革很快使夸美纽斯获得了国际声誉，1641年夏天，他应英国议会的特别邀请来到英国。

The source of the Parliamentary invitation was the extreme dissatisfaction of the newly ascendant Puritans with the state of English higher education; and this in turn was inspired by the second book of Bacon's De Augmentis Scientiarum (1623), which complained that the English universities had failed to keep abreast of the advances of experimental science, that they should be concerned less with books than with things, and that a greater cooperation with the universities of continental Europe was a means to this end. The invitation to Comenius was a first step in addressing these failures, and his leadership in the reform movement was actively sought. But mid-17th-century England was hardly the time or the place for educational reform. Led by John Hampden, John Pym, and Oliver Cromwell, the Long Parliament was already using the Scottish rebellion to press its demands against the King, and within a year the English Civil War had begun. Seeing no reasonable prospect for the translation of his theories into practice, Comenius accepted an earlier call to Sweden, where a similar reform movement, albeit at the primary and secondary level, was already in progress. He left England in June, 1642.

议会邀请的来源是新兴的清教徒对英国高等教育状况的极度不满; 这反过来又受到培根的《德奥格门蒂斯科学馆》(1623)第二本书的启发，该书抱怨英国大学未能跟上实验科学的进步，他们应该更多地关注事物而不是书籍，并且与欧洲大陆的大学进行更大的合作是达到这一目的的一种手段。对夸美纽斯的邀请是解决这些失败的第一步，人们积极寻求他在改革运动中的领导地位。但是17世纪中期的英国几乎不是进行教育改革的时间和地点。在约翰 · 汉普顿、约翰 · 皮姆和奥利弗 · 克伦威尔的领导下，长期议会已经在利用苏格兰人的叛乱向国王施压，一年之内英格兰内战就开始了。看不到将他的理论转化为实践的合理前景，夸美纽斯接受了早些时候对瑞典的呼吁，在那里类似的改革运动，虽然在小学和中学层面，已经在进行中。他于1642年6月离开英格兰。

These events are worth reporting because they illustrate the close connection between Protestantism and educational reform generally, and between Comenius and Francis Bacon, in particular. For among all the abundant and frequently contradictory sources that guided Comenius' educational theories, the thinker he most admired was Bacon, and the method by which he hoped to teach “all things to all men'' was thoroughly inductive and encyclopaedic. Scientihc education, for example, should consist not simply in learning the names of things, but in the actual observation of things themselves. Similarly, the study of language should dismiss the formal rules of grammar, to be conjoined instead with the study of the objects to which linguistic terms refer. In fact, this method should be applied to all subjects of instruction, at the earliest stages of life, publicly rather than privately, and to all classes and both sexes.[18](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark29)

这些事件值得报道，因为它们说明了新教与教育改革之间的密切联系，尤其是夸美纽斯和弗朗西斯 · 培根之间。在夸美纽斯教育理论丰富且经常互相矛盾的源头中，他最钦佩的思想家是培根，他希望用来教授“所有人的一切”的方法是完全归纳和百科全书式的。例如，科学教育不应该仅仅在于学习事物的名称，而应该在于对事物本身的实际观察。同样，对语言的研究应该摒弃语法的形式规则，而应该与对语言术语所指对象的研究结合起来。事实上，这种方法应该适用于所有的教学科目，在生命的最初阶段，公开而不是私下，适用于所有阶层和男女

Admittedly, such realism did not immediately come to dominate the educational practices of western Europe. As “schoolmaster of the Reformation,” Philipp Melanchthon (1497—1560) had quickly reestablished the humanist style of education; and while individual reformers like Francke, Rousseau, Basedow, Pestalozzi, Frobel, and Herbart drew heavily from Comenius’ ideas, the 17th and 18th centuries were largely indifferent to education as the study of things rather than books and ideas (Ulich 1968: 194—5). “The revival of Comenian ideas,’’ one of his biographers thus argued, “really dates from the beginning of the present century, when Germany, crushed and dismembered, looked to her schools as the surest means of regaining fallen glory; so that the battle of Jena may be given as the date of this awakened interest in the refor ms of the Moravian educator’’ (Monroe 1900: 169). The culmination of this revival — itself the model for the reform of French education under the Third Republic[19](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark30) — was the establishment of the Comenius Pedagogical Library (Comenius-Stiftung) in Leipzig in 1871.

诚然，这种现实主义并没有立即主导西欧的教育实践。作为“宗教改革的校长”，菲利普·梅兰希通(1497-1560)迅速重建了人文主义的教育风格，而像弗兰克、卢梭、巴塞多、 Pestalozzi、弗罗贝尔和赫尔巴特这样的个体改革者大量借鉴了夸美纽斯的思想，17和18世纪对教育的研究基本上是漠不关心的，而不是书籍和思想(Ulich 1968:194-5)。他的一位传记作者这样写道: “科梅尼亚思想的复兴，确实可以追溯到本世纪初，当时被粉碎和肢解的德国把她的学校视为重新获得堕落荣耀的最可靠手段; 因此耶拿之战可以作为唤醒人们对摩拉维亚教育家改革的兴趣的日期。”(门罗1900:169)。1871年在莱比锡建立夸美纽斯教育图书馆(夸美纽斯基金会) ，是这种复兴的高潮，也是第三共和国时期法国教育改革的典范。

It is tempting to speculate that Durkheim might have visited the Comenius-Stiftung — whose collection was particularly rich in works on German education — during his stay in Leipzig in 1885 and 1886. But for the notion that Durkheim admired Comenius, and was strongly influenced by his ideas, no speculation is necessary. What was important to Comenius, Durkheim observed, was “to be familiar with things. One must completely overturn the methods which had hitherto been employed in the schools and which substituted texts for things.’’ Education, in short, must be scientific, for “only the sciences can enable us to get to know the world.’’ And in addition education must be encyclopaedic, not in the sense of giving the child an exhaustive knowledge of all the sciences, but rather of giving him a “schematic” knowledge of their fundamental principles. For the child of the future was destined to live in the world, and thus could afford to be ignorant of nothing essential to it. “It was impossible to know in advance what kind of things [the child] would have to deal with,'' Durkheim observed, and thus it was essential to Comenius “that none of them should catch him unprepared” (1977: 287).

人们很容易猜测，涂尔干在1885年和1886年访问莱比锡期间，可能参观过夸美纽斯基金会(Comenius-Stiftung)。夸美纽斯基金会收藏的德国教育作品尤其丰富。但是对于涂尔干崇拜夸美纽斯，并且深受夸美纽斯思想影响的观点来说，没有必要进行猜测。迪尔凯姆认为，对夸美纽斯来说，重要的是“熟悉事物。我们必须彻底颠覆学校中一直以来采用的用文本代替物质的方法。”简而言之，教育必须是科学的，因为“只有科学才能使我们了解世界。”此外，教育必须是百科全书式的，不是要让孩子对所有的科学有一个详尽的了解，而是要让他对这些科学的基本原理有一个“示意图”式的了解。因为未来的孩子注定要生活在这个世界上，因此可以对世界上任何重要的东西一无所知。迪尔凯姆说: “事先不可能知道孩子需要处理什么样的事情,”因此夸美纽斯必须“做好准备”(1977:287)。

It is impossible to exaggerate the extent to which, for Durkheim, these were distinctively German developments. “Everywhere in the Germanic societies,” he noted with approval, “the best minds felt the need to break away from the methods of the Renaissance, no less than with those of Scholasticism, and to educate children in the school of things.” Leibniz himself became the champion of this new conviction, even claiming that “a taste for the real world is one of the distinctive features of German culture.” This in turn led to the establishment of the Realschulen, the earliest secondary schools in which literary instruction was replaced by instruction in “things” and the sciences which deal with these things.11 Among the French, only Montaigne was repulsed by bookish education, accorded no prestige to texts, and demanded that children be placed in direct contact with things; and, as we have seen, Montaigne's opposition to traditional education derived neither from his “scientific spirit'' nor from his “taste for the experimental method,'' but from his skepticism. “How indeed,'' Durkheim thus asked rhetorically, “can we fail to be aware of the abyss which yawns between a sceptic such as Montaigne, for whom all science is an empty artifice . . . and such thinkers as Comenius and Leibniz, who had such a lofty conception of scientific education'' (1977: 289). It is worth noting that Durkheim felt Montaigne stood out among his French contemporaries only because of his “practical cast of mind,'' which Durkheim attributed [20](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark31) to his Jewish origins. But under no circumstances was he in the same class with those German thinkers, and particularly Comenius and Leibniz, who were the legitimate heirs of the “Baconian reformation'' in scienti®c philosophy.

对涂尔干来说，这些都是独特的德国发展，无论如何也不能夸大其词。“在日耳曼社会的各个角落,”他赞许地指出，“最优秀的头脑都觉得有必要摆脱文艺复兴时期的方法，不亚于经院哲学的方法，在物质学校教育孩子。”莱布尼茨本人成为这一新信念的拥护者，甚至声称“对现实世界的品味是德国文化的独特特征之一。”11在法国人中，只有蒙田拒绝书本教育，不给予文本任何声望，要求让孩子直接接触事物; 而且，正如我们所看到的，蒙田对传统教育的反对既不是来自他的“科学精神”，也不是来自他的“实验方法的品味”，而是来自他的怀疑主义。“事实上,”迪尔凯姆反问道，“我们怎么会没有意识到，在怀疑论者如蒙田(Montaigne)与夸美纽斯(Comenius)和莱布尼茨(Leibniz)这样的思想家之间存在着一个深渊呢? 对蒙田而言，所有科学都是空洞的诡计... ... 夸美纽斯和莱布尼茨对科学教育抱有如此崇高的概念。”(1977:289)。值得注意的是，涂尔干认为蒙田之所以在他的法国同时代人中脱颖而出，仅仅是因为他的“实用主义思想”，涂尔干将其中20个归因于他的犹太血统。但在任何情况下，他都不会与那些德国思想家，特别是夸美纽斯和莱布尼茨，他们是科学哲学“培根式改革”的合法继承人，处于同一阶层。

At what late date, therefore, did the French become aware of what the Germans had discovered? When did “educational realism” — the concerted effort to study “things” as well as ideas — begin to slip across the Rhine? Durkheim’s answer to these questions recalls a central theme of Les Formes elementaires, specihcally, the notion that religious symbols are the means whereby primitive societies become conscious of themselves, and that these means become less necessary as individuals become aware that society itself is a sufficient object of veneration. In France, Durkheim thus argued, educational realism became possible only to the extent that the French became capable of thinking of themselves entirely outside that earlier framework of religious symbolism, in so far as French society itself “was coming to be held by individuals, in its own right and in its wholly secular form, in suf®cient esteem for its needs and interests — even the purely temporal ones — to appear as pre-eminently respectable and sacred’’ (1977: 290). In other words, educational realism entered France only in the middle of the 18th century, gained strength as the Revolution approached, and enjoyed its earliest institutional expression in the short-lived “Central Schools’’ introduced by the Convention on 7 Ventose, Year III (February 25, 1795).[21](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark32)

那么，法国人是在什么时候开始意识到德国人的发现的呢？“教育现实主义”ーー对“事物”以及思想的共同研究ーー是什么时候开始滑过莱茵河的？迪尔凯姆对这些问题的回答让人想起了《基本形式》的一个中心主题，特别是宗教符号是原始社会意识到自己的手段，而当个人意识到社会本身是一个充分的崇拜对象时，这些手段就变得不那么必要了。涂尔干因此认为，在法国，教育现实主义之所以成为可能，只是因为法国人开始能够完全脱离早期的宗教象征主义框架来思考自己，因为法国社会本身“正在以其自身的权利和完全世俗化的形式，在对其需求和利益——甚至纯粹的世俗利益——的足够尊重中，逐渐被个人认为是非常值得尊敬和神圣的”(1977:290)。换句话说，教育现实主义在18世纪中叶才进入法国，随着大革命的临近而获得了力量，并在1795年2月25日《文托斯公约》第三年(7 Ventose，Year III，1795)引入的短命的“中央学校”中享受了它最早的制度化表达

Durkheim seems to have conceived this argument as an extension (not criticism or rejection) of the views presented in Hippolyte-Adolphe Taine’s Origines de la France contemporaine (1876—93), which treated the Revolution as an extrapolation of the Cartesian spirit from the world of mathematics and physics to that of politics and morality. Durkheim agreed with Taine that Cartesianism was the legacy inherited by the Third Republic no less than the Enlightenment, adding that “it is a legacy which we must cultivate and not allow to decay.’’ But Durkheim’s originality lay in his insistence that there was also a second, more Germanic legacy: “What is characteristic of [this second legacy],’’ he observed, “is the feeling for reality, the feeling for things, for the place which they occupy in our intellectual and moral life, for everything they are capable of teaching us’’ (1977: 293). It was this second, more experimental condition of mind — quite different from the Cartesian mentality — which had produced the great scientihc advances of the 17th and 18th centuries, and yet was virtually unrepresented in the “largely Cartesian educational system” which existed before the Revolution. To resolve this contradiction between popular realism and institutional Cartesianism, the Convention created a national system of secondary education consisting of a “Central School” in each department. The system was decentralized in the sense that the Central Schools were hnanced and their teachers appointed by the departments; but their curriculum was set by central decree, and included French, history, natural history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, law, drawing, and modern languages (1977: 297).

迪尔凯姆似乎将这一论点视为依波利特·阿道尔夫·丹纳《当代法兰西起源》(Origines de la France Contemporary poraine，1876-93)中观点的延伸(而不是批评或拒绝) ，该书将大革命视为笛卡尔精神从数学和物理世界向政治和道德世界的外推。迪尔凯姆同意泰恩的看法，认为笛卡尔主义是第三共和国继承的遗产，不亚于启蒙运动，并补充说，“这是一个遗产，我们必须培养，不允许腐朽。”但是迪尔凯姆的独创性在于他坚持认为还有第二种更加德国化的遗产: “这第二种遗产的特点,”他说，“是对现实的感觉，对事物的感觉，对它们在我们的知识和道德生活中所占据的位置，对它们能够教给我们的一切的感觉。”(1977:293)。正是这第二种更具实验性的心态ーー与笛卡尔的心态大不相同ーー产生了17世纪和18世纪的伟大科学进步，但在革命前存在的“基本笛卡尔式的教育体系”中几乎没有代表。为了解决大众现实主义和制度化笛卡尔主义之间的这一矛盾，《公约》创建了一个由各部门的“中心学校”组成的国家中等教育体系。这个系统是分散的，因为中央学校是先进的，他们的老师是由系任命的; 但是他们的课程是由中央法令确定的，包括法语、历史、自然历史、数学、物理、化学、法律、绘画和现代语言(1977:297)。

Durkheim’s discussion of the Central Schools is extremely revealing. First, abandoning the system begun in the late 15th century, the Schools had established an entirely new organization in which each discipline was taught in a separate course (some of them lasting several years) by the same teacher. This provided continuity from one year to the next within the same course, while the unity of the cohort was dissolved in a plurality of parallel courses. Individual students could thus pursue as few or as many courses as they wished; and depending on their own preferences or those of their families, they might have a uni®ed, integrated education, or a more specialized preparation for a professional career. As an admirer of the simultaneously intellectual and moral education imposed by the medieval universities, Durkheim objected to the degree of “educational individualism” this organization implied: “A society in which education has become an important factor in social and moral life,’’ he explained, “can no more abandon the educational system than it can the moral system itself to the absolutely arbitrary choice of individuals” (1977: 300—1). But he also recognized that the increasing diversity of social functions, vocations, and aptitudes demanded a corresponding diversity in education; and thus he admired the Convention for attempting to reconcile the idea introduced by Bacon and Comenius — i.e., “that science is a unity, that its different parts are interdependent and inseparable from one another, for ming an organic whole, and that consequently education should be organized in such a way that it respects and even creates awareness of this unity’’ — with the contradictory idea that “the important thing was to equip the child to acquit himself usefully in the social function which it would one day fall to him to ful®l’’ (1977: 295). We see, then, how intimately the central theme of De la division du travail social (1893) ± the need to reconcile the demands of increasing specialization and a complex division of labor with those of ethics and citizenship ± was related to Durkheim's educational thought.

迪尔凯姆关于中央学校的讨论极具启发性。首先，学校放弃了始于15世纪晚期的教育体制，建立了一个全新的组织，在这个组织中，每个学科都由同一位教师在单独的课程中教授(其中一些课程持续了好几年)。这提供了同一课程从一年到下一年的连续性，而同一群体的统一性被分解为多个平行课程。因此，每个学生可以选择他们想选择的课程数量不多或不多; 根据他们自己或家庭的喜好，他们可以接受大学、综合教育，或者为职业生涯做更专业的准备。作为中世纪大学同时推行的知识和道德教育的崇拜者，涂尔干反对这个组织所暗示的“教育个人主义”的程度: “一个教育已经成为社会和道德生活的重要因素的社会,”他解释说，“不能抛弃教育系统，就像它不能抛弃道德系统本身，让个人做出绝对武断的选择一样”(1977:300ー1)。但他也认识到，社会功能、职业和能力的日益多样化要求教育具有相应的多样性; 因此，他赞赏《公约》试图调和培根和夸美纽斯提出的观点ーー即，“科学是一个统一体，它的不同部分相互依存，彼此不可分割，形成一个有机的整体，因此教育应该以这样一种方式组织起来，即它尊重这种统一，甚至创造对这种统一的意识”ーー和矛盾的观点ーー即“重要的是让孩子在社会功能方面做好准备，使他有用地发挥自己的作用，有一天这种作用会落到他身上”(197。因此，我们看到，社会劳动分工的中心主题(1893) ± 需要调和不断增加的专业化和复杂的劳动分工与伦理和公民身份的需求 ± 与涂尔干的教育思想有多么密切的关系。

Not surprisingly, a second reason for Durkheim's interest in the Central Schools was their emphasis on natural science. During the first two “cycles,” comprising four years of study, the attention of the pupils was primarily directed “towards the outside, towards the external world, towards the nature of things” ± i.e., in a “complete reversal of the traditional system” (1977: 297±8). And no less impressive was the fact that these four years were followed by two more devoted to the study of the newly established social and moral sciences. Durkheim was adamant in his insistence that these new sciences were accessible to 16±18-year-old minds, and that the place assigned them in the Central Schools was “in accordance with their nature” (1977: 304). Finally, Durkheim approved of the “spirit” in which they were taught: “people strove to teach about man and matters human in the same spirit and using the same methods as with things material, that is to say, scientihcally” (1977: 298).

毫不奇怪，迪尔凯姆对中央学校感兴趣的第二个原因是他们对自然科学的重视。在最初的两个“周期”中，包括四年的学习，学生的注意力主要集中在“对外部世界，对外部世界，对事物的本质”± ，即“完全颠覆传统体系”(1977:297 ± 8)。同样令人印象深刻的是，在这四年之后，又有两年致力于新建立的社会和道德科学的研究。迪尔凯姆坚持认为，这些新科学对16 ± 18岁的年轻人来说是可以接触到的，中央学校分配给他们的位置“与他们的本性相符”(1977:304)。最后，迪尔凯姆赞同他们被教导的“精神”: “人们努力以同样的精神教导关于人和关于人的问题，并使用与物质相同的方法，也就是说，科学地”(1977:298)。

But despite its virtues, the education offered by the Central Schools had grave organizational flaws ± e.g., an enormous gap between them and the primary schools, the lack of coordination between the courses of study, and the dif®culty of ®nding teachers for the new scientific subjects. This education was also an instrument of the Convention, itself enough to discredit it in the eyes of the Consulate; and finally, it was utterly discordant with the educational views of the ascendant Bonaparte. On 11 Floreal, Year X (1801), it was abolished through a law which, according to Durkheim, “at the same time obliterated all the educational theory of the Revolution.” The Central Schools were replaced by lycees and smaller secondary schools, preparatory for the lycees, called colleges. The organization, subject matter, and teaching methods of secondary education became once more what they had been under the ancien regime. Latin again predominated, and science survived only through the service it provided to the government and the military. “It was a return to the old system,” Durkheim observed. “Everything was to start again” (1977: 305). The Central Schools were an expression of radically new theoretical principles for which real, existing institutions were inadequate. With their failure, these principles would slowly, painfully be rediscovered in the far less innovative century which followed.

但是，尽管中央学校提供的教育有其优点，但它们在组织上存在严重的缺陷，例如，中央学校与小学之间存在巨大的差距，学习课程之间缺乏协调，以及教师对新的科学课程的盲目崇拜。这种教育也是《公约》的一种手段，它本身就足以使《公约》在领事馆眼中失去信誉; 最后，它与占上风的波拿巴的教育观点完全不一致。在 X 年(1801年)的11佛罗里亚，它被废除通过一项法律，根据涂尔干，“同时抹杀了所有的教育理论的革命。”中央学校被中学生和较小的中学所取代，这些中学是为中学生准备的，被称为大学。中等教育的组织、学科和教学方法再次成为旧制度下的样子。拉丁文再次占据主导地位，科学只有通过为政府和军队提供服务才得以幸存。“这是对旧体制的回归,”涂尔干评论道。“一切都将重新开始”(1977:305)。中央学校是一种全新的理论原则的体现，而现有的真正的理论体系是不够的。由于这些原则的失败，这些原则将慢慢地、痛苦地在随后创新性大大减弱的世纪中被重新发现。

The record of 19th century educational reform was thus one of extraordinary instability. From 1802 to 1870, Durkheim recalled 74 promulgations, decrees, and/or circulars that had modi®ed French education, yielding 15 signi®cantly different sets of curricula. Scien-ti®c education in particular suffered from a “curious alliance” between humanism and the Church, in which the tools of literary education were adapted to the needs of orthodoxy, while liberals assumed the defense of a more scienti®c education.[22](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark33) The alliance itself was explained as the result of the historical association between the Revolution and science — epitomized in the short-lived Central Schools — as well as the more general association of science with “the profane” (1977: 310). These associations made, the Church sided with the literary tradition of Renaissance humanism, and the resulting conflict with liberalism and science left education subject to the inconstant winds of political fortune, from the Consulate and the First Empire to the very eve of Durkheim’s lectures in 1904.

因此，19世纪教育改革的记录是非常不稳定的。从1802年到1870年，迪尔凯姆回顾了74个修改法国教育的公告、法令和/或通告，产生了15套截然不同的课程。科学教育尤其受到人文主义和教会之间“奇怪的联盟”的影响，在这种联盟中，文学教育的工具适应了正统教育的需要，而自由主义者则承担了保护更多科学教育的责任。22这种联盟本身被解释为革命和科学之间的历史联系的结果ーー缩影在短命的中央学校ーー以及科学与“世俗”之间更普遍的联系(1977:310)。这些联系建立起来，教会站在了文艺复兴人文主义的文学传统一边，由此产生的与自由主义和科学的冲突使教育受制于政治命运的变化无常的风，从领事馆和第一帝国到1904年涂尔干演讲的前夕。

Durkheim's goal was to resolve this antinomy through a secondary education which was neither vocational (its purpose was not to prepare students for a particular skill or profession) nor purely literary (it should still prepare students to bene®t from such career training later in life). Durkheim’s intentions here are perhaps best approximated by saying that he felt secondary education should be theoretical — i.e., it should cultivate “the reflective faculties,’’ teaching students how “to think, to judge and to reason’’ (1977: 314—15). Ironically, this emphasis on reflection, judgment and reasoning (in the apparent absence of any speci®c subject-matter) gave Durkheim’s pedagogical theories an initially “formalist” aspect reminiscent of the Scholastics and humanists. Was secondary education thus to fashion the mind, in a general kind of way, or was it to furnish and nourish it? But Durkheim’s point was precisely that such alternatives, framed in this dichotomous manner, distort the nature of reflection and reasoning itself. The mind, he insisted, “is not an empty vessel which can be directly moulded in the same way as one moulds a glass, which one subsequently fills up. The mind is made for thinking about things, and it is by making it think about things that one fashions it. Right thinking is a matter of thinking aright about things” (1977: 318).

迪尔凯姆的目标是通过中等教育来解决这一矛盾，中等教育既不是职业教育(其目的不是为学生准备特定的技能或职业) ，也不是纯粹的文学教育(它仍然应该为学生在今后的生活中从这种职业培训中受益做好准备)。迪尔凯姆在这里的意图也许最好的近似是说他认为中等教育应该是理论性的ーー也就是说，它应该培养“反思能力”，教学生如何“思考、判断和推理”(1977:314ー15)。具有讽刺意味的是，这种对反思、判断和推理的强调(在明显缺乏任何特定主题的情况下)使涂尔干的教育理论最初的“形式主义”方面让人想起经院哲学家和人文主义者。中等教育是以一种普遍的方式来塑造人的思想，还是提供和滋养人的思想？但迪尔凯姆的观点恰恰是，这样的选择，以这种二分法的方式，扭曲了本质的反思和推理本身。他坚持认为，心灵“不是一个空容器，可以像一个人塑造一个玻璃杯那样直接塑造，然后再把它装满。头脑是用来思考事物的，而且是通过让它思考事物来塑造它的。正确的思维是对事物正确思考的问题”(1977:318)。

The right way of thinking also varies according to the nature of the things thought about. Echoing Boutroux’s criticism of Descartes, for example, Durkheim argued that we don’t reflect upon mathematical things in the same way that we reflect on physical objects, for there are “diverse forms of reflectiveness which are a function of the objects to which it is applied’’ (1977: 318). In addition, thinking varies according to the substantiality of such things. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, for example, reflection was applied to a subject-matter which was “infinitely tenuous and transparent in texture; the knowledge which it comprised constituted a very small body of information; it was even, in a sense, composed of abstractions, of intellectual concepts, rather than objectively given realities existing outside the mind.’’ In realist education, by contrast, thought would be applied “to solid, consistent and resilient objects, to objects from which we have much to learn, and which the mind is forced to reckon with, according to which it must fashion itself’’ (1977: 318).

正确的思维方式也会根据所思考事物的性质而有所不同。例如，回应布特鲁克斯对笛卡尔的批判，迪尔凯姆认为，我们反思数学事物的方式与我们反思物理对象的方式不同，因为“反思的形式多种多样，这是它所应用的对象的功能”(1977:318)。此外，根据这些事物的实质性不同，思维也会有所不同。例如，在中世纪和文艺复兴时期，反思被应用到一个主题上，这个主题“在质地上是无限薄弱和透明的; 它所包含的知识构成了一个非常小的信息体; 在某种意义上，它甚至是由抽象概念和知识概念组成的，而不是客观地给予存在于头脑之外的现实。”相比之下，在现实主义教育中，思想应该“应用于坚实、一致和有弹性的对象，应用于我们有很多要学习的对象，应用于头脑被迫思考的对象，头脑必须根据这些对象来塑造自己”(1977:318)。

What, then, were these “solid, consistent and resilient’’ objects to which thought should be applied? Such objects, Durkheim observed, were comprised in two large categories - the one of physical nature, the other of persons and consciousness - and both occupy an important place in secondary education. Durkheim’s discussion of the ®rst category reveals his belief in the moral value of scienti®c education, as well as its roots in Christian idealism. We have already seen how Durkheim praised the medieval notion that the principal aim of education is not to give the child “pieces of knowledge,’’ but rather to produce “some deep and internal state of mind’’ (1977: 30). The same spirit led Durkheim to reject any utilitarian explanation for or justi®cation of scienti®c education. If the rapid growth of science in the 17th and 18th centuries could be explained by the needs of an increasingly commercial and industrial society, for example, then only engineers, industrialists and businessmen would require a scienti®c education. But Durkheim insisted that some scienti®c education is essential for magistrates, lawyers, historians, men of

那么，这些“坚实、一致和有弹性”的对象是什么，思想应该应用到它们身上？迪尔凯姆观察到，这些物体分为两大类——一类是物理本质，另一类是人和意识——两者在中等教育中都占有重要地位。迪尔凯姆对第一种范畴的讨论，揭示了他对科学教育道德价值的信仰，以及科学教育根源于基督教唯心主义。我们已经看到涂尔干如何赞扬中世纪的观念，即教育的主要目的不是给孩子“一些知识”，而是产生“一些深层次的和内在的精神状态”(1977:30)。同样的精神导致涂尔干拒绝任何功利主义的解释或正义的科学教育。例如，如果17、18世纪科学的迅速发展可以用一个日益商业化和工业化的社会的需求来解释，那么只有工程师、工业家和商人才需要接受科学教育。但涂尔干坚持认为，一些科学教育是必不可少的地方法官，律师，历史学家，人的

letters, or statesmen as well, for without it one is inevitably regarded as being intellectually incomplete. Similarly, if a scienti®c education were to be justified only on the ground of its utility, it would be an inferior kind of education; for “teaching is educational only in as far as ... it has the capacity of exerting a moral influence on the way we are and the way we think; in other words, in as far as it effects a transformation in our ideas, our beliefs and our feelings” (1977: 336)- .               .

信件，或政治家，因为没有它，一个人不可避免地被认为是智力上的不完整。同样地，如果科学教育仅仅因为它的实用性而被证明是正当的，那么它将是一种次等的教育; 因为“教育只有在... ... 它有能力对我们现在的方式和我们思考的方式施加道德影响; 换句话说，只要它影响我们的思想、信仰和感情的转变”(1977:336)-。.

This observation was a part of Durkheim’s broader conviction — so powerfully developed in Les Formes elementaires — that Christian doctrine comprised not so much false propositions as profound truths encoded in symbols. Transposed into the realm of educational policy, this conviction yielded an insistence that modern education, rightfully and necessarily secular, must still acknowledge the real moral and spiritual needs of its constituents. The existence of cosmologies in even the most idealist religions, for example, reflects a recognition of man’s place in nature, and his dependence upon it. That secular education which would replace its Christian antecedent, therefore, must also teach man his place within the order of nature.

这种观察是迪尔凯姆更广泛信念的一部分ーー这种信念在 Les Formes 基本教义中得到了强有力的发展ーー即基督教教义所包含的错误命题，与其说是真理，不如说是象征符号中蕴含的深刻真理。转换到教育政策领域，这种信念产生了一种坚持，即现代教育，理所当然和必然的世俗化，仍然必须承认其成员的真正的道德和精神需求。例如，即使在最理想主义的宗教中，宇宙学的存在也反映了对人在自然中的地位及其对自然的依赖性的认识。因此，取代其基督教先例的世俗教育，也必须教导人类在自然秩序中的位置。

The example of religious cosmologies, incidently, was not chosen haphazardly, for as a student of Boutroux, Durkheim was always deeply concerned with the philosophical questions of freedom, necessity, and determinism. “Depending on how we envisage the world,’’ he felt, “we develop quite different conceptions of the part we have to play in it, and consequently of what we ourselves truly are. The world will appear radically different depending on whether it is conceived of as being governed by the arbitrary whim of fate (as in ancient times) or by a benevolent personal Providence, or at the other extreme by laws of necessity which we can do nothing to alter.’’ Durkheim considered this question far too important to be left to philosophy. The truth about natural necessity must be taught, not by philosophers, in their general, abstract way, but rather by scientists, and “in a particular sort of way, just as humanity itself gradually came to understand it in the course of its history, by observing the clustering of phenomena according to necessary connections deriving from the nature of things’’ (1977: 338).

宗教宇宙学的例子，偶然地，并不是随意选择的，因为作为布特鲁克斯的学生，涂尔干总是深切关注的哲学问题的自由，必要性，和决定论。“取决于我们如何看待这个世界,”他觉得，“我们对于自己在其中扮演的角色，以及因此对于我们自己到底是什么，形成了截然不同的概念。这个世界看起来会完全不同，这取决于它是否被认为是由命运的随心所欲(就像在古代一样)支配，或者是由仁慈的个人天意支配，或者是在另一个极端，由我们无法改变的必然法则支配。”涂尔干认为这个问题太重要了，不能留给哲学去解决。关于自然必然性的真理必须由科学家而不是哲学家以他们一般的、抽象的方式来教授，而且“以一种特殊的方式，正如人类自身在其历史进程中逐渐理解它一样，通过观察现象的聚集，根据从事物的本质中产生的必要联系”(1977:338)。

The study of nature, in short, was the ®rst step to a deeper knowledge of ourselves. Durkheim thus seems to have shared the humanist view that all education — including scienti®c education — was essentially anthropocentric. But for Durkheim, the crucial premise underlying this view was the conviction that man was himself a part of nature. The human domain, he argued, was simply “the natural domain . . . subject to the same essential laws as the other realms of nature.” And if human reality was thus a reality like any other, then there could exist “no special privileged procedures for understanding [its laws], no mysterious avenues which allow us to dispense with the tortuous and toilsome roads which physicists, chemists and biologists are forced to follow in their investigations.” Here Durkheim’s social realism came into direct conflict with his Cartesian culture, for here “privileged procedures” and “mysterious avenues’’ referred unmistakably to the traditional methods of French rationalism — introspection and deduction — which were now to be dismissed. Instead, Durkheim insisted, we must observe human reality “in the same way as we observe things in the external world, that is to say from the outside; we must experiment and make use of induction or, if experimentation in the strict sense is in practice impossible, we must find a way of setting up objective comparisons which can fulfil the same logical functions’’ (1977: 342);

简而言之，对自然的研究是深入了解我们自己的第一步。因此，涂尔干似乎赞同人本主义的观点，即所有的教育ーー包括科学教育ーー本质上都是以人为中心的。但是对涂尔干来说，支撑这一观点的关键前提是坚信人本身就是自然的一部分。他认为，人类领域只是“自然领域... ... 受制于与其他自然领域相同的基本法则。”如果人类的现实和其他任何现实一样，那么就不会存在“理解[其法则]的特殊特权程序，也不会存在让我们摆脱物理学家、化学家和生物学家在研究中被迫遵循的曲折和艰辛道路的神秘途径。”涂尔干的社会现实主义在这里与他的笛卡尔主义文化产生了直接冲突，因为这里的“特权程序”和“神秘途径”明确无误地指的是法国理性主义的传统方法ーー自省和演绎ーー现在被摒弃了。相反，涂尔干坚持认为，我们必须观察人类现实“就像我们观察外部世界的事物一样，也就是说从外部; 我们必须实验和利用归纳法，或者，如果严格意义上的实验在实践中是不可能的，我们必须找到一种建立客观比较的方法，这种方法可以履行同样的逻辑功能”(1977:342) ;

Durkheim’s call for educational realism was thus a call for a “new rationalism” in French thought. The “old” rationalism of Descartes had set itself the admirable task of molding human reason; but this had been the reason of the 17th and 18th centuries, of mathematicians who “could only see things in simplified and idealised form, who reduced man to clear thinking and the world to its geometrical for ms.’’ In some sense, of course, the French must always remain Cartesian rationalists — i.e., “men who are concerned with clarity of thought’’ — for this is “the essential attribute of our race; it is our national quality, and the qualities of our language and our style are only a result of it.’’ But the French rationalists of the future would have to acknowledge that things, “whether human or physical, are irreducibly complex,’’ that “simple conceptual combinations” could no longer be mistaken for reality itself, and that the “infinite richness’’ of nature, including human nature, would have to be more carefully observed (1977: 348).

涂尔干对教育现实主义的呼吁就是对法国思想中“新理性主义”的呼吁。笛卡尔的“旧”理性主义为自己设定了塑造人类理性的令人钦佩的任务; 但这也是17、18世纪数学家们“只能以简单化和理想化的形式看待事物，他们为了女士而把人类简化为清晰的思维，把世界简化为几何形状”的原因。当然，在某种意义上，法国人必须始终保持笛卡尔理性主义ーー即“关心思维清晰的人”ーー因为这是“我们种族的本质属性; 这是我们的民族品质，我们的语言和风格的品质只是它的结果。”但是，未来的法国理性主义者将不得不承认，事物，“无论是人类还是物理，都是不可简化的复杂”，“简单的概念组合”不能再被误认为现实本身，自然的“无限丰富”，包括人性，将不得不更仔细地观察(1977:348)。

The study of the second category of “solid, consistent and resilient’’ objects — i.e., persons and consciousness — had of course been a distinctive feature (albeit from a special point of view) of Renaissance humanism. But for two reasons Durkheim felt that the humanist approach to the study of man no longer met the needs of the modern world. The first was the Renaissance preoccupation with classical ± and especially Roman ± civilization. As we have seen, from the very first of these lectures, Durkheim had emphasized that education requires a culture; and the only culture available to the early Christians was, paradoxically, that of pagan antiquity. Moreover, since Christianity evolved within the context of the Roman Empire, and since Latin was inevitably the language of the Church, the Christians naturally viewed Rome as a society created by Providence, in which “for the first time man had succeeded in achieving self-awareness, a knowledge of his true nature, and consequently of the principle on which true morality and true religion are grounded” (1977: 322). The resulting postulate of Christian humanism was that Latin literature provided the best source of knowledge about human nature, a postulate which, according to Durkheim, was still the foundation of the defense of a classical education.

研究第二类“坚固、一致和有弹性”的物体ーー即人和意识ーー当然是区辨特征的文艺复兴人文主义(尽管是从一个特殊的角度)。但是，有两个原因使涂尔干觉得人文主义的研究方法不再适应现代世界的需要。首先是文艺复兴时期对古典文明尤其是罗马文明的关注。正如我们所看到的，从这些讲座的第一个，涂尔干强调，教育需要一种文化; 和唯一的文化可用的早期基督徒，矛盾的是，异教的古代。此外，由于基督教是在罗马帝国的背景下发展起来的，而且拉丁语不可避免地成为了教会的语言，基督徒自然而然地将罗马看作是上帝创造的社会，在这个社会中，“人类第一次成功地获得了自我意识，获得了对自身真实本性的认识，从而获得了真正道德和真正宗教所依据的原则”(1977:322)。由此产生的基督教人文主义假设是，拉丁文学提供了关于人性的最佳知识来源，根据迪尔凯姆的说法，这一假设仍然是古典教育辩护的基础。

In opposing this postulate of Latin preeminence, Durkheim again revealed the extent of his debt to the German romantics ± particularly Herder and von Humboldt ± and their rejection of the Enlightenment’s preoccupation with Roman antiquity. “Latin civilisation,” Durkheim flatly asserted, “is in no way entitled to a position of pre-eminence.” Roman innovations in law and political organization notwithstanding, Greek genius is reflected in art, poetry, history, philosophy, and science. “If there ever has been a society where human beings succeeded in realising to the full their essential nature,’’ Durkheim observed, “it is far more plausible to locate that society in Athens rather than Rome’’ (1977: 324). It would be a mistake, however, simply to class Durkheim with the German rather than the French humanists ± i.e., as one who preferred the Greek to the Roman model of human nature and civilization. For Durkheim’s attack was on humanism itself; and this brings us to the second, and more decisive, of Durkheim’s reasons for opposing Renaissance and Enlightenment theories of education.

在反对这种拉丁文优越性的假设时，涂尔干再次揭示了他对德国浪漫主义者(尤其是赫尔德和冯 · 洪堡)的亏欠程度，以及他们对启蒙运动对罗马古代的全神贯注的反对。“拉丁文明,”涂尔干断然断言，“根本没有资格享有至高无上的地位。”尽管罗马在法律和政治组织方面有所创新，但希腊的天才在艺术、诗歌、历史、哲学和科学方面都有所体现。涂尔干评论道: “如果曾经有一个社会，人类成功地充分认识到了自己的本质，那么将这个社会定位在雅典比定位在罗马更合理。”(1977:324)。然而，简单地把涂尔干与德国人而不是法国人文主义者划等号是错误的，也就是说，他更喜欢希腊人而不是罗马人性和文明的模式。因为涂尔干的攻击是针对人文主义本身的; 这就把我们带到了涂尔干反对文艺复兴和启蒙教育理论的第二个，也是更具决定性的理由。

Such theories, Durkheim observed, are based on the premise that human nature is “universally and eternally the same,’’ that its essence “does not vary from one age to another,’’ that man “has had this particular nature ever since he came into being, and it is only his lack of self-awareness which has prevented his true nature from expressing itself freely’’ (1977: 321, 324). Implicit within the Roman legal system (the idea of a system of laws valid for all humanity), this same premise could be found in the Christian idea of original sin (an essential human nature corrupted by a contingent historical event), the Renaissance study of classical literature (the means to rediscover the essential traits of human nature), and the Enlightenment criticism of the arti®cialities of modern civilization (distortions and corruptions of a more natural, sublime human character). And this premise granted, there could be but one kind of education ± the confrontation of the child with this pure, original, uni®ed, and uncorrupted human nature.

迪尔凯姆观察到，这些理论基于这样一个前提，即人类的本性是“普遍而永恒的相同”，其本质“不因时代而变化”，人类“自诞生以来就具有这种特殊的本性，只是因为他缺乏自我意识，才使他的本性无法自由表达”(1977:321,324)。在罗马法律体系(法律体系对全人类都有效的观念)中，同样的前提可以在基督教的原罪观念(被偶然的历史事件腐蚀的基本人性)、文艺复兴时期对古典文学的研究(重新发现人性基本特征的手段)以及对现代文明艺术的启蒙运动批判(更自然、更崇高的人性的扭曲和腐败)中找到。在这个前提下，只有一种教育可以让孩子面对这种纯粹的，原始的，统一的，不受污染的人性。

There was no idea to which Durkheim was more opposed. “This assumption,” he insisted, “constitutes the most flagrant contradiction of everything we know from the study of history. Far from being immutable, humanity is in fact involved in an interminable process of evolution, disintegration and reconstruction; far from being a unity, it is in fact in®nite in its variety, with regard to both time and place.” Moreover, Durkheim here referred not simply to variations in the “external forms of life” — e.g., language, clothing, ritual, etc. — but, more deeply, to “the fundamental substance of their way of conceiving the world and conducting themselves in it.”[23](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark34) For Durkheim, this insistence comprised both moral and epistemological components. The ®rst reflects Durkheim's ethical relativism: “The view that there is one single moral system valid for all men at all times,” he argued, “is no longer tenable. History teaches us that there are as many different moral systems as there are types of society” (1977: 325). The Renaissance conception of “man” itself, despite its generalized and abstracted character, was the “idiosyncratic and transitory” product of “very special circumstances” (a peculiar confluence of Greek, Roman, and Christian elements) in the history of European civilization; and in the same way, the “cult of the individual” was a peculiar, spontaneous emanation of modernity which, transposed into the Graeco-Roman world, would have introduced principles leading to the very destruction of those societies. Like Fustel, therefore, Durkheim again stressed the chasm which separated the ideas and institutions of antiquity from those that succeeded the Revolution; but where, for Fustel, this insistence embodied an affection for the institutions of the ancien regime and an Enlightenment conception of intellectual progress, for Durkheim ± as we shall see in chapter 4 (esp. pp. 185—209) ± it reflected the influence of German romanticism and experimental science, and a resulting effort to discredit the ideal of a classical education.

不知道涂尔干更反对哪一个。“这个假设,”他坚持说，“构成了我们从历史研究中所知道的一切的最明显的矛盾。人类不是一成不变的，实际上是无休止的进化、分裂和重建的过程; 不是一个整体，实际上在时间和地点上都是多种多样的夜晚。”此外，涂尔干在这里不仅仅指的是“外在生命形式”的变化ーー例如语言、服装、仪式等ーー而且更深入地指的是“他们构想世界和在其中行事的方式的基本实质。”23对涂尔干来说，这种坚持既包括道德成分，也包括认识成分。第一个反映了涂尔干的伦理相对主义: “有一个单一的道德体系在任何时候都适用于所有人的观点,”他辩称，“已经站不住脚了。历史告诉我们，有多少种社会类型，就有多少种不同的道德体系”(1977:325)。文艺复兴时期的“人”概念本身，尽管具有广义和抽象的性质，是欧洲文明史上“非常特殊的情况”(希腊、罗马和基督教元素的特殊汇合)的“特殊和短暂”的产物; 同样，“个人崇拜”是现代性的一种特殊的、自发的发散，如果转换到 Graeco-Roman 世界，就会引入导致这些社会彻底毁灭的原则。因此，像福斯特尔一样，涂尔干再次强调了古代思想和制度与革命后的思想和制度之间的鸿沟; 但是，对于福斯特尔来说，这种坚持体现了对古代制度和启蒙思想进步概念的热爱，正如我们将在第四章中看到的那样。它反映了德国浪漫主义和实验科学的影响，以及随之而来的对古典教育理想的质疑。

Quite aside from this ethical relativism, Durkheim’s educational theories also embodied that epistemological relativism more fully and famously expressed in “De quelques formes primitives de la classification” (1903) and Les Formes elementaires de la vie religieuse (1912). Like those works, L'Evolution pedagogique takes the “principle of noncontradiction” ± the notion that, by definition, self-contradictory propositions are false ± as paradigmatic. More than any other, Durkheim observed, this principle seems to us inseparable from logical thought itself. Yet there are symbolic systems which, in the course of history, have played a role at least as great as that of modern science, but in which this principle is violated with impunity. Here Durkheim was referring particularly to the symbolic systems of religion, or religious myths, but he was perfectly willing to extend the same argument to include “different systems of logic’’ which are “equally grounded in the nature of reality, that is, in the nature of different societies’’ (1977: 326; 1915: 25±33, 53-7). If it was thus “natural” for 17th- and 18th-century rationalists to conceive of man in an abstract, generalized fashion, Durkheim regarded this conception as inadequate in the light of the empirical studies of history and society of the 19th century. What was needed, therefore, was not so much a new approach to the study of man, for this had already been provided by the German historians and social scientists; rather, what the French needed was a new conception of human nature itself -i.e., one which acknowledged its “irreducibly diverse’’ variations and their social causes.

除了这种伦理相对主义，涂尔干的教育理论还体现了认识论相对主义更充分和著名的表达在“德一些形式的原始分类”(1903年)和 Les Formes 的基本形式的宗教生活(1912年)。像这些著作一样，L’进化教育学采用“不矛盾原则”± 的概念，根据定义，自相矛盾的命题是错误的 ± 作为范式。涂尔干观察到，在我们看来，这个原则似乎与逻辑思维本身密不可分。然而，在历史进程中，有一些象征性的系统起到了至少与现代科学同样重要的作用，但在这些系统中，这一原则受到了违反而不受惩罚。涂尔干在这里特别提到了宗教或宗教神话的象征系统，但他完全愿意将同样的论点扩展到包括“不同的逻辑系统”，这些逻辑系统“同样基于现实的本质，即不同社会的本质”(1977:326; 1915:25 ± 33,53-7)。如果17世纪和18世纪的理性主义者以一种抽象的、广义的方式来构想人是“自然的”，那么涂尔干认为，根据对19世纪历史和社会的实证研究，这种构想是不充分的。因此，我们所需要的并不是一种新的研究人类的方法，因为德国历史学家和社会科学家已经提供了这种方法; 相反，法国人所需要的是一种关于人性本身的新概念——也就是说，一种承认其“不可减少的多样性”的变化及其社会原因的概念。

Durkheim’s relativism here was a direct extension of his political commitments. For while he admitted that human nature “cannot become just anything at all,’’ he also argued that the plasticity of human nature is far greater than popular opinion suggests. If the present moral order seems to us the only one possible, it is simply because we are so accustomed to living within its constraints. History, by contrast, “showing that this moral order came into being at a particular time under particular circumstances . . . justifies us in believing that the day may eventually come when it will give way to a different moral order based on different ethical principles.” Inversely, of course, history also encourages caution in the face of utopian, revolutionary enthusiasms, teaching us that “man does not change arbitrarily” or “at will on hearing the voices of inspired prophets.” Change takes place “only in response to the demands of necessity,” as the consequence of “the whole network of diverse causal relationships which determine the situation of man” (1977: 329—30). In sum, ethical and historical relativism — underwritten, as we shall see, by German realism, historicism, and social science — was among the more powerful resources Durkheim brought to his arguments for political and educational reform.[24](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark35)

涂尔干在这里的相对主义是他的政治承诺的直接延伸。虽然他承认人性“不可能成为任何东西”，但他也认为，人性的可塑性远远超出了大众观点所认为的。如果我们认为目前的道德秩序是唯一可能的，那只是因为我们习惯于生活在它的约束之下。相比之下，历史“表明，这种道德秩序是在特定情况下的特定时间形成的... ... 我们有理由相信，终有一天，它会让位于基于不同道德原则的不同道德秩序。”当然，与此相反，历史也鼓励我们在面对乌托邦式的革命热情时保持谨慎，告诉我们“人不会随心所欲地改变”或者“只要聆听灵感迸发的先知的声音”作为“决定人类处境的各种因果关系的整个网络”(1977:329-30)的结果，变化“只是在必要性的要求下才发生”。总之，伦理和历史相对主义ーー正如我们将看到的，由德国现实主义、历史主义和社会科学所支持ーー是涂尔干为他的政治和教育改革论点提供的更有力的资源之一

The lectures comprising L'Evolutionpedagogique were lectures on the history of educational thought; and their central theme was that this history — by revealing the diversity and relativity of educational ideals — subverts the humanist and Enlightenment conception of an abstract, unified human nature. A society’s ideal conception of man, which its educational system then strives to reproduce, is always the contingent product of changing forms of social organization. Pedagogic ideals thus express, not the proclivities of human nature, but the needs of particular societies; and education is the means by which societies continuously reproduce the conditions of their own existence. What, then, were the needs of Durkheim’s own society? What educational ideal would provide their most adequate expression? What conception of man was the contingent product of those forms of social organization characteristic of the Third Republic? These, of course, are sociological — not historical — questions; and in 1898 — 9, Durkheim had offered a lecture-course on moral education at the university of Bordeaux, where he attempted to answer them.[25](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark36) In 1902—3, this became the first of the courses on education he offered at the Sorbonne, to be repeated in 1906—7 and 1911 — 12; and though the transcript of the lectures is incomplete,[26](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark37) its publication as L'Education morale (1925) provides us with some of the clearest insights into Durkheim’s social realism.

包含进化教育学的讲座是关于教育思想史的讲座，其中心主题是这段历史ーー通过揭示教育理想的多样性和相对性ーー颠覆了人文主义和启蒙运动关于抽象的、统一的人性的概念。一个社会的理想人的概念，其教育系统然后努力复制，始终是社会组织形式变化的偶然产物。因此，教育理想表达的不是人性的倾向，而是特定社会的需要; 教育是社会不断重现其自身存在条件的手段。那么，涂尔干自己的社会需求是什么呢？什么样的教育理想可以提供他们最充分的表达？什么样的人的概念是第三共和国特有的那些社会组织形式的偶然产物？当然，这些都是社会学问题，而不是历史问题，1898年9月，迪尔凯姆在波尔多大学举办了一个关于道德教育的讲座，他试图在那里回答这些问题。251902年3月，这成为他在 Sorbonne 举办的第一个关于教育的课程，并在1906年7月和1911年12月重复进行。

DISCIPLinE, ATTACHMENT, AND AUTONOMY

纪律、依附和自主

To understand L'Education morale, it is important to have a grasp of two of Durkheim’s fundamental ideas. The first — extremely important in his later studies of comparative religion — is his notion of “the duality of human nature’’ (1913a; 1914; Jones and Vogt). In each of us, Durkheim argued, there are two beings: the first comprises all the mental states (e.g., desires, interests, inclinations, etc.) which apply to us as individuals; the second includes those ideas, sentiments, and practices (e.g., moral, religious, political, occupational, etc.) which express the groups of which we are a part. In one sense, this idea represents a kind of sociological interpretation of the traditional Kantian antinomies. But one must also take seriously Steven Lukes’ remark about how closely Durkheim here resembles Freud. Like Freud, for example, Durkheim saw nothing in the congenital nature of human beings which might make them adhere to moral rules, worship divinities, or obey political leaders. On the contrary, at birth, the individual child was a sel®sh, asocial, egoistic being; and to this being, as rapidly as possible, another must be added by the educational institutions of a society. “Education is not limited to developing the individual organism in the direction indicated by nature,’’ Durkheim insisted, or “to eliciting the hidden potentialities which need only be manifested. It creates in man a new man, and this man is made up of all the best in us, of all that gives value and dignity to life’’ (1956: 124—5). As Durkheim’s work matured, he increasingly saw this imposition of society upon the individual as one wrought with conflict. The requirements of society, he observed, “are quite different from those of our nature as individuals,” and thus society could not maintain itself “without our being required to make perpetual and costly sacri®ces.” In short, we must “do violence to certain of our strongest inclinations.”[27](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark38)

要理解涂尔干的教育道德观，掌握涂尔干的两个基本思想是很重要的。第一个ーー在他后来的宗教比较研究中极其重要ーー是他的“人性的二重性”(1913年 a; 1914年; 琼斯和沃格特)的概念。涂尔干认为，在我们每个人身上都有两种存在: 第一种存在包括适用于我们作为个体的所有精神状态(如欲望、兴趣、倾向等) ; 第二种存在包括表达我们作为其中一部分的群体的思想、情感和实践(如道德、宗教、政治、职业等)。从某种意义上说，这种观点代表了对传统康德悖论的一种社会学解释。但我们也必须认真对待史蒂文 · 卢克斯关于涂尔干与弗洛伊德有多么相似的评论。例如，像弗洛伊德一样，迪尔凯姆在人类的先天本性中没有看到任何可能使他们坚持道德规则、崇拜神灵或服从政治领袖的东西。相反，在出生时，每个孩子都是一个自私的、不合群的、自私自利的个体; 对于这个个体，一个社会的教育机构必须尽快增加另一个个体。迪尔凯姆坚持认为: “教育不仅仅局限于按照自然所指示的方向发展个体的有机体，也不仅仅局限于挖掘那些只需要表现出来的隐藏的潜能。”。它在人身上创造了一个新的人，这个人是由我们身上所有最好的东西，所有赋予生命价值和尊严的东西组成的”(1956:124ー5)。随着涂尔干作品的成熟，他越来越多地将社会对个人的强加看作是一种冲突。他观察到，社会的要求“与我们作为个体的天性有很大的不同”，因此，社会“如果不被要求做出永久和昂贵的牺牲”，就无法维持自身简而言之，我们必须“对我们某些最强烈的倾向采取暴力”27

Durkheim’s second idea was that these “new men” of the Third Republic - who were to be secular, rational, and in direct contact with things - could not be produced simply by removing all supernatural elements from their education. On the contrary, Durkheim constantly criticized his fellow republicans and radicals for thinking of secularization as a purely negative operation (1961: 7—8). Religion and morality, Durkheim observed, had been inextricably related throughout human history, a connection so deep and long-standing that some moral ideas had become virtually indistinguishable from their religious connotations: “[I]f, in rationalizing morality, one con®nes himself to withdrawing] from moral discipline everything that is religious without replacing it, one almost inevitably runs the danger of withdrawing at the same time all elements that are properly moral. Under the name of rational morality, we would be left only with an impoverished and colorless morality’’ (1961: 8—9).

涂尔干的第二个观点是，第三共和国的这些“新人”——他们是世俗的、理性的、与事物直接接触的——不能简单地通过从他们的教育中去除所有超自然因素而产生。相反，迪尔凯姆不断批评他的共和党同僚和激进分子认为世俗化是一个纯粹的消极行动(1961年7月8日)。涂尔干观察到，宗教和道德在整个人类历史中有着不可分割的联系，这种联系是如此深刻和长久，以至于一些道德观念实际上已经变得与它们的宗教内涵几乎没有区别: “[我] f，在道德的合理化过程中，一个人欺骗自己退出]道德规范，一切宗教性的东西都没有被取代，一个人几乎不可避免地面临着同时退出所有适当的道德元素的危险。在理性道德的名义下，我们将只剩下贫乏和无色的道德”(1961:8ー9)。

In short, Durkheim explained, it is not enough just to remove or eliminate the supernatural; on the contrary, a “profound trans-for mation’’ is necessary, which means replacing it with something concrete and real: “We must seek, in the very heart of religious conceptions, those moral realities that are, as it were, lost and dissimulated in it. We must disengage them, ®nd out what they consist of, determine their proper nature, and express them in rational language. In a word, we must discover the rational substitutes for those religious notions that for a long time have served as the vehicle for the most essential ideas’’ (1961: 9). In his later work, Durkheim was thus preoccupied with the idea of taboo — the veritable exemplar of the “sacredness” of moral rules — which he had ®rst discovered in Fustel’s La Cite antique, then rediscovered in the more detailed ethnographic studies epitomized in Frazer’s The Golden Bough. The rules of morality, like those objects considered taboo by primitive peoples, were things “set aside,’’ granted a special dignity, removed from common scrutiny, not subject to free discussion or criticism. And this similarity between the rules of morality and those

简而言之，涂尔干解释说，仅仅消除或消除超自然现象是不够的; 相反，“深刻的转化”是必要的，这意味着用具体和真实的东西来取代它: “我们必须在宗教概念的核心中寻找那些道德现实，它们在其中迷失和掩饰。我们必须解除它们的束缚，弄清它们是由什么组成的，确定它们的本质，并用理性的语言来表达它们。总之，我们必须找到那些长期以来作为最基本思想的载体的宗教观念的合理替代品”(1961:9)。在他后期的作品中，迪尔凯姆因此全神贯注于禁忌的概念ーー道德规则的“神圣性”的真正典范ーー这是他最初在 Fustel 的拉城古董中发现的，然后在弗雷泽的金树枝中概括的更详细的人种学研究中重新发现的。道德规则，就像那些被原始人视为禁忌的东西一样，是被“搁置”的东西，被赋予了特殊的尊严，脱离了常人的审视，不受自由讨论或批评的影响。道德准则和

of taboo were still more obvious when these rules were violated; for in both cases, violations were accompanied by a kind of indignation and outrage not provoked by mere transgressions of practical wisdom or professional technique.

在违反这些规则的情况下，禁忌的性质更为明显; 因为在这两种情况下，违反行为都伴随着一种义愤和愤怒，而不仅仅是因为违反了实际智慧或专业技能。

How, then, was this special feature of morality ± i.e., its sacred, categorical, obligatory quality ± to be explained? So long as religion and morality had been inextricably related, Durkheim reminded his audience, this question could be answered easily. The sacred, categorical, obligatory quality of moral rules was regarded as the direct emanation of the divinity, and no further explanation was required. But such an explanation was palpably inconsistent with Durkheim’s “rationalist postulate” — i.e., that nothing in the natural world is beyond explanation by human reason. This was the problem which Kant had left the modern world, one which Kant himself found inexplicable outside of some sort of religious context (MacIntyre 1981: 53—4). It was also Durkheim’s problem and, so far as Durkheim was concerned, the fundamental problem of the Third Republic: “[I]f we methodically reject the notion of the sacred without systematically replacing it by another,’’ he observed, “the quasi-religious character of morality is without foundation, (since we are rejecting the traditional conception that provided that foundation without providing another). One is, then, almost inevitably inclined to deny morality’’ (1961: 10).

那么，如何解释道德的这一特性，即它神圣的、绝对的、强制性的特性？涂尔干提醒他的听众，只要宗教和道德有着千丝万缕的联系，这个问题就很容易回答。道德规范的神圣性、绝对性、强制性被认为是神性的直接发散，不需要进一步的解释。但是，这样的解释明显与涂尔干的“理性主义假设”不一致ーー即，自然界中的任何事物都不是人类理性所无法解释的。这就是康德离开现代世界时遇到的问题，康德自己发现这个问题在某种宗教背景之外是无法解释的(麦金太尔1981:53ー4)。这也是涂尔干的问题，就涂尔干而言，这也是第三共和国的根本问题: “如果我们有条不紊地拒绝神圣的概念，而不系统地用另一个概念取而代之,”他说，“道德的准宗教性质是没有基础的，(因为我们拒绝的传统概念提供了这个基础而没有提供另一个基础)。因此，一个人几乎不可避免地倾向于否认道德”(1961:10)。

Moreover, it is abundantly clear that Durkheim did not conceive of this as a merely theoretical or philosophical problem. On the contrary, it was eminently practical, for in so far as this sacred quality of moral rules lacked any explanation, it also lacked any justification; and in the absence of justihcation, it would be impossible to make the children of the Third Republic — the “new men’’ of the future — experience its reality at all. It is here, therefore, in the first pages of L'Education morale, that the discussion of the Jesuits found in L'Evolution pedagogique becomes transparent. Feeling that he was speaking in the name of a higher reality, Durkheim now observed, the schoolmaster “elevated himself, invested himself with an extra energy. If we do not succeed in preserving this sense of self and mission for him — while providing, meanwhile, a different foundation for it — we risk having nothing more than a moral education without prestige and without life’’ (1961: 11). Durkheim, of course, was convinced that there was a “different foundation” for it in “the nature of things’’ — and one thus perfectly consonant with his rationalist postulate. And (pace Kant) precisely because a new, secular, moral order was impossible without a rational explanation (and thus justification) for the categorical aspect of moral rules, the discovery of this “foundation in the nature of things” was the ®rst task of those who would secularize education. Science, including social science, thus took on a morally imperative character of its own.

此外，非常清楚的是，迪尔凯姆并不认为这仅仅是一个理论或哲学问题。相反，它非常实际，因为这种道德规则的神圣品质既没有任何解释，也没有任何正当理由; 没有正当理由，就不可能让第三共和国的孩子——未来的“新人”——体验到它的现实。正是在这里，因此，在 L’教育的士气的第一页，讨论耶稣会发现在 L’进化教育法变得透明。涂尔干现在觉得自己是在以一个更高的现实的名义说话，这位教师“提升了自己，投入了额外的精力。如果我们不能成功地为他保持这种自我意识和使命感ーー同时为它提供一个不同的基础ーー我们就有可能只得到一种没有威望和没有生命的道德教育”(1961:11)。当然，迪尔凯姆相信“事物的本质”有一个“不同的基础”ーー这个基础与他的理性主义假设完全一致。而且(康德)正是因为一个新的，世俗的，道德秩序是不可能的，没有一个理性的解释(从而证明)的范畴方面的道德规则，发现这个“基础的性质”是世俗化教育的人的第一个任务。科学，包括社会科学，因此呈现出它自己的道德命令性质。

As we have seen, Durkheim was clearly an ethical relativist, convinced that both the form and content of moral injunctions should change in response to the new social conditions facing the Third Republic; but he was also an ethical traditionalist, in so far as he insisted that morality should retain each of the “basic elements” that had typi®ed it since the Middle Ages, hidden beneath the “guise” of religion. How were such elements to be discovered? The answer of the traditional rationalist, Durkheim observed, had three parts. The ®rst was the premise of the self-sufficient moral agent, that “each of us carries within himself all the elements of morality.” The second was the method of introspection, that “we have only to look inside ourselves with a little care to discover the meaning of morality. So the moralist engages in introspective inquiry and, from amongst the ideas that he has more or less clearly in mind, seizes upon this one or that as seeming to represent the central notions of morality” (1961: 21-2). And third, this idea (e.g., utility, perfection, human dignity, etc.) ®rmly in hand, the traditional rationalist logically deduced rules or principles applicable to speci®c circumstances, which serve as the guides for moral behavior.

正如我们所看到的，迪尔凯姆显然是一个伦理相对主义者，深信道德禁令的形式和内容应该随着第三共和国面临的新的社会条件而改变; 但他也是一个伦理传统主义者，因为他坚持道德应该保留自中世纪以来在宗教的“伪装”下打印出来的每一个“基本元素”。这些元素是如何被发现的？涂尔干观察到，传统理性主义者的答案分为三部分。前者是自给自足的道德行为者的前提，即“我们每个人都在自己身上携带着所有的道德要素。”第二种是自省的方法，“我们只需要稍微注意一下自己的内心，就能发现道德的意义。因此，道德家进行反思性的探究，并从他或多或少清楚地记在心里的观点中，抓住这个或那个似乎代表了道德的中心概念”(1961:21-2)。第三，这种观念(如功利、完美、人的尊严等)牢牢地掌握在传统理性主义者的手中，他们从逻辑上推导出适用于特定情况的规则或原则，作为道德行为的指导。

Durkheim was extremely critical of the traditional rationalism in all three areas. The Kantian notion of the self-suf®cient moral agent, for example, was contradicted by the ultimately social nature of all moral categories; but this was less Durkheim's premise than his conclusion, and it bore commensurately less weight at this early point in the lectures. Of the introspective method, Durkheim simply observed that it was “arbitrary” and “subjective,” yielding only those ideas which the moralist himself had personally contrived: “We cannot base practice on such subjective hypotheses as these,” he insisted, “We cannot regulate the education that we owe our children on the basis of such purely academic conceptions'' (1961: 22—3). Durkheim’s major objections to the more traditional rationalism were thus directed primarily at its reliance on deduction, its concomitant and apparently complete disregard for empirical evidence, and its unwillingness to extend the study of legal and economic facts to their ethical counterparts — in short, its reluctance to study moral facts as things: “[O]ne can inquire what morality ought to be,” he observed, “only if one has first determined the complex of things that goes under this rubric, what its nature is, what ends it serves. Let us begin, then, by looking at morality as a fact, and let us see what we are actually able to understand by it” (1961: 23).

涂尔干在这三个方面都对传统的理性主义提出了强烈的批判。例如，康德关于自足的道德行为者的概念，与所有道德范畴的最终社会性质相矛盾; 但这与其说是迪尔凯姆的前提，不如说是他的结论，而且在讲座的早期阶段，它的重要性也相应地降低了。对于内省的方法，涂尔干只是观察到它是“武断的”和“主观的”，只能产生那些道德家自己设计的想法: “我们不能把实践建立在这样的主观假设之上,”他坚持说，“我们不能把我们欠孩子的教育建立在这样纯粹的学术概念之上”(1961:22ー3)。涂尔干对传统理性主义的主要反对意见主要针对其对演绎的依赖，它的伴随和显然完全无视经验证明，以及它不愿意将法律和经济事实的研究扩展到他们的伦理对应物ーー简而言之，它不愿意将道德事实作为事物来研究: “人们可以探究道德应该是什么,”他说，“只有当一个人首先确定了这个标题下的事物的复杂性，它的本质是什么，它的目的是什么。那么，让我们开始把道德看作一个事实，让我们看看我们实际上能够通过它理解什么”(1961:23)。

What does this empirical examination of moral facts reveal? Initially, Durkheim observed, all moral behavior seems to conform to preestablished rules. In this sense, we can say that morality consists of “a system of rules of action that predetermine conduct. They state how one must act in given situations; and to behave properly is to obey conscientiously” (1961: 24). But where traditional rationalists, both Kantian and utilitarian, had insisted that these rules were derived from some more general principle, Durkheim insisted that they were the products of quite speci®c social circumstances. Like his discussion of the educational theories of the Renaissance and Enlightenment, therefore, Durkheim's treatment of the derivation of moral rules bore a strongly romantic, anti-intellectualist cast. Neither the categorical imperative nor the law of utility had or could yield a single moral rule; on the contrary, these rules constituted the reality from which such philosophical principles were later abstracted: “[I]n fact and in practice,” Durkheim insisted, “it is not according to theoretical insights or general formulae that we guide our conduct, but according to speci®c rules applying uniquely to the special situation that they govern. In all signi®cant life situations, we do not refer back to the so-called general principle or morality to discover how it applies in a particular case and thus learn what we should do. Instead there are clear-cut and specific ways of acting required of us.”[28](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark39)

这种对道德事实的实证检验揭示了什么？最初，涂尔干观察到，所有的道德行为似乎都符合既定的规则。从这个意义上说，我们可以说道德包括“一个预先决定行为的行为规则体系”。他们陈述了一个人在特定的情况下必须如何行动; 行为得体就是认真地服从”(1961:24)。但是传统的理性主义者，无论是康德还是功利主义者，都坚持认为这些规则来源于一些更普遍的原则，涂尔干则坚持认为它们是相当特殊的社会环境的产物。因此，就像他对文艺复兴和启蒙运动的教育理论的讨论一样，迪尔凯姆对道德规则衍生的处理带有强烈的浪漫主义和反智主义色彩。无论是定言令式还是效用法则都没有或者不能产生一个单一的道德规则，相反，这些规则构成了这些哲学原则后来被抽象出来的现实: “事实和实践中,”迪尔凯姆坚持说，“我们指导我们的行为不是根据理论洞察力或一般公式，而是根据特定的规则，这些规则只适用于它们所支配的特殊情况。在所有重要的生活情境中，我们不会回过头来参考所谓的一般原则或道德，以发现它如何在特定情况下适用，从而了解我们应该做什么。相反，我们需要采取明确而具体的行动方式。”28

Thus far, Durkheim's argument placed a strong emphasis on constancy and regularity, on the function of morality in eliminating the arbitrary element in human behavior: “Morality is basically a constant thing,” he insisted, “and so long as we are not considering an excessively long time span, it remains ever the same. A moral act ought to be the same tomorrow as today, whatever the personal predispositions of the actor” (1961: 27). The traditional rationalism, he seemed to suggest, with its insistence on philosophic principles, reflective decision, and rational agency, should yield to a quite different rationalism, one which acknowledged the unconscious, unreflective influences on moral behavior. In short, Durkheim wished to forge a close relation between custom and morality.

到目前为止，迪尔凯姆的论证强调了恒定性和规律性，强调了道德在消除人类行为中的武断因素方面的作用: “道德基本上是一个恒定的东西,”他坚持说，“只要我们不考虑过长的时间跨度，它就永远不会改变。一个道德行为明天应该和今天一样，不管行为者的个人倾向如何”(1961:27)。他似乎认为，传统的理性主义坚持哲学原则、反思性决策和理性代理，应该屈服于一种截然不同的理性主义，一种承认无意识、不反思性对道德行为的影响的理性主义。总之，迪尔凯姆希望在风俗和道德之间建立一种密切的关系。

This powerfully suggestive association, so opposed to the more traditional rationalism of the 17th and 18th centuries, was one of Durkheim’s more distinctive contributions to French thought. But it was almost never put forward without a caveat reminiscent of Kant. For the regularity and constancy of custom, like that of habit, is experienced as the expression of an inclination or a preference. A moral rule, by contrast, is experienced as something external, an order originating outside ourselves, regardless of any personal preference: “There is in it,’’ Durkheim insisted, “something that resists us, is beyond us. We do not determine its existence or its nature. It is independent of what we are. Rather than expressing us, it dominates us’’ (1961: 28). In addition to the notion of regularity, therefore, the conception of rules involves the idea of authority. And it is because of this authority, not because of the inclination born of habit or custom, that we do what we ought to do. Moral behavior thus comprises both constancy and command; and these are joined together in the idea of discipline, the first element of morality. “Discipline in effect regularizes conduct,’’ Durkheim observed. “It implies repetitive behavior under determinate conditions. But discipline does not emerge without authority — a regulating authority. Therefore . . . the fundamental element of morality is the spirit of discipline” (1961: 30—1).

这种强有力的暗示性联想，与17和18世纪更为传统的理性主义相对立，是涂尔干对法国思想更为独特的贡献之一。但它几乎从来没有提出过没有一个警告让人想起康德。因为习惯的规律性和恒定性，就像习惯的规律性和恒定性一样，是作为一种倾向或偏好的表达而体验的。相比之下，道德规则被体验为一种外在的东西，一种源于我们自身之外的秩序，而不管我们的个人偏好如何: “在它里面,”涂尔干坚持认为，“有些东西在抵制我们，在我们之外。我们不能决定它的存在或性质。它独立于我们是什么。而不是表达我们，它支配我们”(1961:28)。因此，除了规则的概念之外，规则的概念还包括权威的概念。正是因为这种权威，而不是因为习惯或习俗所产生的倾向，我们才做我们应该做的事。因此，道德行为包括恒定性和命令性，这两者在道德的第一要素——纪律的观念中结合在一起。“纪律实际上规范了行为,”迪尔凯姆评论道。“这意味着在特定条件下的重复行为。但没有权威，纪律就不会出现ーー一个监管机构。因此... 道德的基本要素是纪律的精神”(1961:30ー1)。

The notion that discipline was an element of morality, of course, was hardly original with Durkheim. On the contrary, it already held a special place in the arguments of both Kantians and utilitarians, where it identified and then directed the behavior required by either the categorical imperative or the principle of the greatest good for the greatest number. The distinctive feature of Durkheim’s argument, therefore, was his insistence that discipline was good intrinsically, that it derived its raison d’etre neither from the particular behavior in question nor from the consistency of the maxim guiding it with some abstract principle, but quite literally from itself. It is good that man is disciplined, Durkheim argued, regardless of the specific acts which such discipline constrains him to perform, because discipline is natural to human beings.

当然，纪律是道德的一个要素这个概念并不是迪尔凯姆的原创。相反，它已经在康德和功利主义者的论证中占据了特殊的位置，在那里，它确定并指导了定言令式或最大利益原则所要求的行为。因此，迪尔凯姆论点的区辨特征在于，他坚持认为，纪律本质上是好的，它的存在理由既不是来自于所讨论的特定行为，也不是来自于用某种抽象原则指导它的准则的一致性，而是来自于它本身。迪尔凯姆认为，不管这种纪律约束人们去做什么具体的行为，人们遵守纪律是好的，因为纪律对人类来说是自然的。

It is important to understand the specific features of Durkheim’s argument here, for it expressed his most characteristic views of human nature and freedom, as well as his social realism. From 18th-century classical economists to Bentham to “major socialist theoreticians,” the tendency had been to regard moral and legal constraints as “doing violence to human nature,’’ and thus as justifiable only on the ground that the behavior it secured was useful or even essential to human welfare. But Durkheim’s point — unmistakably drawn from Rousseau — was precisely that these constraints imply no interference with the normal workings of human nature whatsoever. On the contrary, discipline is necessary because it is demanded by nature itself; and the inability to restrict one’s needs and desires within certain limits is unnatural and pathological. As we shall see in chapter 5 (see pp. 291—301), Durkheim’s argument here was identical to the one presented in Le Suicide (1897), where he insisted that happiness is possible only given the acceptance of limits upon one’s aspirations, and where anomie results from the absence of such constraint. As in Le Suicide, for example, Durkheim appealed to physical and biological analogues to underscore the “natural” aspect of constraint (1961: 40—1; 1951: 247). The moral and spiritual life, he acknowledged, transcends the physical and organic sphere, and thus enjoys no material limitations to its expansion (1961: 41; 1951: 247—8); but both physically (as a part of the universe) and morally (as a part of society), man is a particular, limited being, a part of the larger whole.

这里有必要了解涂尔干论证的具体特征，因为它表达了涂尔干最具特色的人性观和自由观，以及他的社会现实主义观。从18世纪的古典经济学家到边沁(Bentham) ，再到“主要的社会主义理论家”，人们倾向于将道德和法律约束视为“对人性的暴力行为”，因此只有在它所保证的行为对人类福祉有用甚至是必要的基础上才是合理的。但是迪尔凯姆的观点(毫无疑问是从卢梭那里得出的)恰恰是，这些约束意味着，人性的正常运作不受任何干扰。相反，纪律是必要的，因为它是自然本身所要求的; 不能在一定限度内限制一个人的需要和欲望是不自然的和病态的。正如我们将在第五章看到的(见第291-301页) ，迪尔凯姆在这里的论点与《自杀》(1897)中的论点相同，他坚持认为，只有接受对一个人的愿望的限制，才有可能获得幸福，而失范则是由于缺乏这种限制而导致的。例如，在《自杀》一书中，迪尔凯姆呼吁物理和生物类比来强调约束的“自然”方面(1961:40ー1; 1951:247)。他承认，道德和精神生活超越了物质和有机的领域，因此在其扩展上没有物质上的限制(1961:41; 1951:247ー8) ; 但无论是物质上(作为宇宙的一部分)还是道德上(作为社会的一部分) ，人都是一个特殊的、有限的存在，是更大整体的一部分。

The constraints imposed upon human beings were thus less violations of nature than the means whereby human nature realized itself. If we regard discipline as good, Durkheim thus observed, “it is not that we regard the work of nature with a rebellious eye, or that we see here a diabolical scheme that must be foiled; but that man’s nature cannot be itself except as it is disciplined. If we deem it essential that natural inclinations be held within certain bounds, it is not because that nature seems to us bad, or because we would deny the right to grati®cation; on the contrary, it is because otherwise such natural inclinations could have no hope of the satisfaction they merit’’ (1961: 50—1). This position owes a great deal to Rousseau, in that constraints imposed upon one’s desires increase rather than decrease one’s freedom; but it is also unmistakably hostile to liberal individualism, in that constraints are imposed, not by reason or nature, but by society. But as Durkheim would argue in Les Formes elementaires, reason is the product of social forces, and society is itself a part of nature.

因此，对人类施加的限制与其说是对自然的侵犯，不如说是对人类实现自然的手段的侵犯。如果我们认为纪律是好的，涂尔干这样评论道: “并不是我们用反叛的眼光看待大自然的工作，也不是我们在这里看到一个必须被挫败的恶魔计划，而是人的本性除了被纪律约束之外不能成为它自己。如果我们认为必须把自然的倾向控制在一定的范围内，这并不是因为自然对我们来说是坏的，或者是因为我们拒绝享受的权利; 相反，这是因为否则这种自然的倾向就不会有得到它们应得的满足的希望”(1961:50ー1)。这一立场在很大程度上要归功于卢梭，因为强加在一个人的欲望上的限制增加而不是减少了一个人的自由; 但它也明确地敌视自由个人主义，因为这种限制是由社会而不是由理性或自然强加的。但正如迪尔凯姆在 Les Formes elementaires 所说，理性是社会力量的产物，社会本身就是自然的一部分。

Like his discussion of anomie, Durkheim’s remarks on educational discipline also had an unmistakable contemporary referent — i.e., the “malady of infiniteness” felt by the bourgeoisie of the Third Republic. Moral discipline having lost its ascendancy over the individual will, Durkheim viewed his contemporaries as beset by unlimited aspirations which, inevitably unfulfilled, in turn gave rise to the pessimism and anguish so poignantly described in Goethe’s Faust (Durkheim 1961: 43). But precisely because he saw moral discipline not as ruthlessly suppressing a recalcitrant human nature, but rather as the means by which that nature fulfilled itself, Durkheim cannot be cast as simply a sentimental conservative longing for the imagined moral certainties of the past. For human nature, like its physical counterpart, has a history; and as that nature changes through time, becoming “stronger and more vigorous,’’ so also must that moral discipline through which it is expressed.

与他对失范的讨论一样，迪尔凯姆关于教育纪律的评论也有一个明确的当代指涉ーー即第三共和国资产阶级所感受到的“无限的弊病”。道德准则已经失去了对个人意志的支配地位，迪尔凯姆认为他的同时代人被无限的愿望所困扰，这些愿望不可避免地没有实现，反过来又导致了悲观主义和痛苦，这在歌德的《浮士德》(迪尔凯姆1961:43)中得到了深刻的描述。但正是因为他认为道德纪律不是无情地压制顽固的人性，而是大自然自我实现的手段，涂尔干不能简单地被描绘成一个多愁善感的保守主义者，渴望过去想象中的道德确定性。因为人类的本性，就像它的物理对应物一样，有一段历史; 随着自然随着时间的推移而变化，变得“更强大和更有活力”，所以道德规范也必须通过它来表达。

Durkheim thus complained of the arrogance of those static systems of thought which “would prohibit us from going beyond the points reached by our fathers, or would wish us to return there. The normal boundary line,’’ he insisted, “is in a state of continual becoming, and any doctrine which, under the authority of absolute principles, would undertake to ®x it immutably, once and for all, must sooner or later run up against the force of the changing nature of things’’ (1961: 51—2). Moreover, as he had already argued in De la division du travail social, this “continual becoming’’ was not limited simply to the constant expansion of the range of morally respectable behavior. It comprised changes in the forces constraining that behavior as well. Habit, custom, and tradition might be sufficient for relatively simple societies; but with the growth of commerce, industry, and a complex division of labor, reason, reflection, and social criticism must come to the fore. A belief in the spirit of discipline — the ®rst element of morality — need not imply a blind or slavish submission. But it did involve authority, and the question of how such authority could be maintained in a manner consistent with the “new rationalism” lay at the very heart of Durkheim’s social realism.

涂尔干因此抱怨那些静态思想体系的傲慢，它们“禁止我们超越我们的祖先达到的点，或者希望我们回到那里。正常的边界线,”他坚持说，“处于一种不断变化的状态，任何教义，在绝对原则的权威下，将承诺永久地、一劳永逸地 x 它，迟早都会遇到事物不断变化的性质的力量”(1961:51ー2)。此外，正如他在《社会工作的分工》一书中所论证的那样，这种“持续的成为”不仅仅局限于道德上受尊重的行为范围的不断扩大。它还包括制约这种行为的力量的变化。对于相对简单的社会来说，习惯、风俗和传统可能已经足够了; 但是随着商业、工业和复杂的劳动分工的发展，理性、反思和社会批评必须出现。对纪律精神的信仰ーー道德的第一要素ーー不一定意味着盲目或盲从。但它确实涉及到权威，而这种权威如何能够以一种与“新理性主义”相一致的方式得以维持的问题，正是迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义的核心所在。

This preliminary focus of L'Education morale on discipline — on the formal aspect of moral rules — was decidedly rationalist, still echoing the concerns of Rousseau, Kant, and their 18th-century predecessors. But the lingering atmosphere of rationalism quickly faded as Durkheim turned to the content of the moral life. Ignoring Kant's insistence that experience had nothing to teach us about ethics, Durkheim's approach was determinedly inductive, searching out those acts to which the adjective “moral” is in fact attached, and then classifying them according to their common characteristics. The word “moral” is incorrectly predicated of acts in the pursuit of personal goals, for example, simply because “there never has existed any people among whom an egoistic act — that is to say, behavior directed solely to the interest of the person performing it — has been considered moral” (1961: 58). So the behavior prescribed by the rules of morality must always be that in pursuit of impersonal ends. Durkheim's point was not simply that “moral” acts must be those which look to the interest of others — even many others. On the contrary, Durkheim agreed with Spencer that the morality which elevated the interests of others above those of the self could never be universalized (and thus could never be a “morality”), for no one could then accept the self-denial of others, renunciation having become impossible. Philanthropy, in short, is a reciprocal activity in which some must play the role of beneficiaries. Morality, by contrast, must by dehnition be common and accessible to all, and addressed to a living, sentient being outside the self. The only empirically observable entity fitting this description is that which individuals create through their association — i.e., society. Like Hume, therefore, Durkheim rejected the benefits enjoyed either by the self or by others as the criterion for the determination of distinctively moral acts. Moral acts are rather those which are “publicly” useful, addressed to society as a whole, not to its individual members; and the moral life begins where the individual becomes attached to a social group.[29](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark40)

L’教育对纪律的初步关注ーー关于道德规则的形式方面ーー显然是理性主义的，仍然呼应着卢梭、康德及其18世纪前辈的关切。但是，随着涂尔干转向道德生活的内容，挥之不去的理性主义氛围很快就消失了。迪尔凯姆的方法是坚定的归纳法，他忽略了康德坚持认为经验没有什么可以教给我们关于伦理学的东西，他找出那些与形容词“道德”事实上相关的行为，然后根据它们的共同特征对它们进行分类。例如，“道德”这个词被错误地断言为追求个人目标的行为，仅仅是因为“从来没有任何人的利己主义行为ーー也就是说，完全为了实现它的人的利益的行为ーー被认为是道德的”(1961:58)。因此，道德规范所规定的行为必须始终是追求客观目的的行为。涂尔干的观点不仅仅是“道德”行为必须是那些关注他人(甚至是许多其他人)利益的行为。相反，迪尔凯姆同意斯宾塞的观点，认为将他人的利益置于自我利益之上的道德永远不可能被普遍化(因此也永远不可能成为一种“道德”) ，因为没有人能够接受他人的自我否定，放弃已经变得不可能。简言之，慈善是一种互惠活动，其中一些人必须扮演受益者的角色。相比之下，道德必须是普遍的，所有人都可以理解的，并且是针对自我之外的一个活生生的、有感情的存在。唯一符合这种描述的经验观察到的实体是个人通过他们的联合创造的实体ーー也就是社会。因此，像休谟一样，迪尔凯姆拒绝将自我或他人所享有的利益作为确定独特道德行为的标准。道德行为是那些“公开”有用的行为，是针对整个社会的，而不是针对个体成员的; 道德生活开始于个体与一个社会群体的联系。29

In this way, Durkheim smoothly folded a major part of the traditional morality of the Church — the good works done by one individual for another, or many others — beneath the “higher” morality of the Republic. There are no genuinely moral ends besides collective ends, and charitable acts “of person to person” thus have no intrinsic moral value. Is society wrong, therefore, in placing a value on such personal acts? Certainly not. But the value thus attached to charity is derived indirectly. Here Durkheim presents two arguments which are not always distinguishable: first, the tendency to perform charitable acts “prepare[s] and incline[s]” one to seek genuinely moral ends; and second, since — by Durkheim’s conception of the duality of human nature (see above) — society is reflected in each individual, it is impossible to serve the former without simultaneously serving the latter as well. “Charity,” Durkheim concluded, “has moral value only as a symptom of a moral state with which it is associated; because it points to a moral propensity to sacri®ce, to go beyond one’s self, to go beyond the circle of self-interest, it clears the way for a true morality’’ (1961: 83). Here again Durkheim blends utilitarian arguments with those of Rousseau and Kant. The individual rendered helpless against the growing tide of social evils, the only truly effective remedy lies in the social organization of welfare. And while this more collective approach denies the individual the pleasure of observing the consequences of his charitable act, social welfare acquires a higher moral status precisely because it is so general and impersonal.

通过这种方式，涂尔干顺利地将教会传统道德的一个主要部分——一个人为另一个人或许多其他人做的善事——置于共和国“更高”的道德之下。除了集体目的之外，没有真正的道德目的，“个人对个人”的慈善行为也就没有内在的道德价值。因此，社会对这种个人行为的重视是错误的吗？当然不是。但是，这种对慈善的附加价值是间接获得的。在这里，迪尔凯姆提出了两个并不总是可以区分的论点: 第一，慈善行为的倾向“准备[ s ]和倾向[ s ]”一个寻求真正的道德目的; 第二，由于ーー迪尔凯姆的人性二重性的概念(见上文)ーー社会反映在每个个体中，如果不同时为后者服务，就不可能为前者服务。迪尔凯姆总结道: “慈善的道德价值仅仅是与之相关的道德状态的一种症状; 因为它指向一种道德倾向——牺牲、超越自我、超越自我利益的循环，它为真正的道德扫清了道路”(1961:83)。在这里，涂尔干再次将功利主义的论点与卢梭和康德的论点混为一谈。面对日益增长的社会弊端，个人无能为力，唯一真正有效的补救办法在于社会福利的组织。虽然这种更为集体的方法剥夺了个人观察其慈善行为后果的乐趣，但社会福利之所以获得更高的道德地位，恰恰是因为它是如此普遍和客观。

The “attachment to social groups’’ thus became the second element of any truly “moral” education. And just as the ®rst — the spirit of discipline — had introduced an apparent, almost Platonic opposition between human desires and self-discipline (resolved through Durkheim’s appeal to the “natural” and “intrinsic” qualities of constraint), the second now seemed to imply a similar renunciation, the submersion of the individual personality in that of the group. This second renunciation received the same treatment as the ®rst. The ®rst two elements of moral education thus recapitulated the distinction between “regulation” and “integration” explored in Le Suicide.[30](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark41) Acknowledging that the individual and society were “different beings, with different natures,’’ Durkheim went on to insist that “far from there being some inexpressible kind of antagonism between the two, far from its being the case that the individual can identify himself with society only at the risk of renouncing his own nature either wholly or in part, the fact is that he is not truly himself, he does not fully realize his own nature, except on the condition that he is involved in society’’ (1961: 67—8). The formal element of discipline was thus counterbalanced by the content of the moral consciousness - the ideas, feelings, habits, and inclinations which constitute the “most important part of ourselves.” But these, like the spirit of discipline, have their origin in society, creating the “strongest and most intimate connection” between the individual and the social order.

因此，“对社会群体的依恋”成为任何真正的“道德”教育的第二个要素。正如第一种——纪律的精神——在人类欲望和自律之间引入了一种明显的、几乎是柏拉图式的对立(通过迪尔凯姆对“自然”和“内在”约束品质的诉求得到了解决) ，第二种现在似乎意味着一种类似的放弃，将个体人格淹没在群体人格之中。第二次放弃和第一次放弃受到同样的对待。道德教育的前两个要素因此重新概括了《自杀》中探索的“规范”和“整合”之间的区别。迪尔凯姆承认个人和社会是“不同的存在，有着不同的本质”，他继续坚持认为“两者之间远非存在某种无法表达的对立，远非个人只有在完全或部分放弃自己的本质的风险下才能认同自己与社会的关系，事实是他不是真正的自己，他没有完全认识到自己的本质，除非他参与社会”(1961:67ー8)。因此，纪律的形式要素被道德意识的内容——构成“我们自己最重要部分”的思想、感情、习惯和倾向——所抵消但是这些，就像纪律的精神一样，起源于社会，在个人和社会秩序之间创造了“最强烈和最密切的联系”。

To what groups, therefore, ought one to be attached? One’s family? One’s country? Or humanity itself? And in what degree? In this period of increasing hostility between France and Germany, what was the appropriately “moral” posture for a French citizen? Durkheim’s answer introduced and articulated what might be called “centripetal patriotism.” Family, country, and humanity represented different, mutually complementary stages in the social and moral evolution of France. In the present, each had its proper function, engaging the individual in a different way, and answering a different moral need. But there was no need to choose between them; indeed, a man could be “morally complete’’ only when simultaneously governed by all three. Yet these three groups could not be of equal moral value, for Durkheim had a clear sense of the declining role of the family relative to the State. Because the family was closer to the individual, it provided less impersonal - and thus less morally elevated - goals. In addition, societies constantly evolved toward more centralized, public activities which drew the individual out of the domestic circle, and involved him in more generalized activities.

因此，一个人应该属于哪些群体？一个人的家人？国家？还是人性本身？到什么程度了？在法国和德国之间敌意日益加深的时期，对于一个法国公民来说，什么是恰当的“道德”姿态？迪尔凯姆的回答引出并阐明了所谓的“向心的爱国主义”家庭、国家和人类代表了法国社会和道德演变中不同的、相互补充的阶段。在当下，每一种都有其适当的功能，以不同的方式吸引个体，并回应不同的道德需求。但是没有必要在这三者之间做出选择; 事实上，一个人只有同时受到这三者的支配，才能“道德上完整”。然而，这三个群体不可能具有同等的道德价值，因为涂尔干清楚地意识到家庭相对于国家的作用正在下降。因为家庭更接近个人，所以它提供的目标不那么客观，因此也不那么道德高尚。此外，社会不断向更加集中的公共活动发展，这些活动将个人从家庭圈子中吸引出来，使他们参与更加广泛的活动。

The real question - crucial to Durkheim’s social realism - was whether the State should in turn be subordinated to humanity. “There could not be a graver issue,’’ Durkheim observed, “since the orientation of moral activity will be altogether different and moral education understood in almost contrary fashion, depending on the group to which priority is accorded’’ (1961: 75). Of course, the same arguments that cast the family in a role subordinate to the State - e.g., the impersonality of the State’s moral goals, their removal from temporal, spatial, and ethnic contingencies, the generally more public trend of social evolution, etc. - might easily be invoked on behalf of humanity. But here again we must recall that Durkheim’s constant preoccupation with the idea of society as both a necessary and a sufficient moral entity was justified by its concrete objectivity — its preeminence as a thing. For only when understood in this way could society become an adequate, secular substitute for the traditional Church. “Humanity,” by contrast, was a mere abstraction, a word used to describe the sum of states, nations, and tribes, but possessing no consciousness, individuality, or social organization of its own. As such, it could never be a sufficient object of our moral conduct.

真正的问题——对涂尔干的社会现实主义至关重要——是国家是否应该反过来从属于人类。涂尔干评论道: “没有比这更严重的问题了，因为道德活动的方向是完全不同的，道德教育的理解方式几乎是相反的，这取决于优先考虑的群体”(1961:75)。当然，把家庭置于从属于国家的角色中的相同论点——例如，国家道德目标的客观性，它们从时间、空间和种族偶然性中移除，社会进化的普遍趋势，等等——可能很容易被人类所引用。但在这里，我们必须再次回顾，涂尔干一直关注的社会既是一个必要的，又是一个充分的道德实体的理念，是由其具体的客观性ーー它作为一个事物的卓越性所证明的。因为只有以这种方式来理解，社会才能成为传统教会的适当的、世俗的替代品。相比之下，“人性”仅仅是一个抽象概念，一个用来描述国家、民族和部落之和的词，却没有自己的意识、个性或社会组织。因此，它永远不可能成为我们道德行为的充分客体。

How was the resulting paradox — i.e., the apparent contradiction between the concrete objectivity of society and the impersonality of genuinely moral goals — to be resolved? Durkheim’s answer was that we should pursue these goals, however ideal and impersonal, through the most concrete, well-defined group of which we are members — i.e., the modern nation-state. In practice, this meant that the state should not expand militarily, politically, or economically to the detriment of its neighbors, and should rather focus on the material and moral well-being of its own citizens. This internal, “centripetal” patriotism — so completely at odds with the early, colonialist policies of the Third Republic — need not submerge the peculiar national characters of the societies in question. The French genius for “clear and distinct ideas’’ might thus collaborate with the German taste for the complexities of real experience to achieve the higher ends of humanity itself.[31](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark42) Given Durkheim’s conviction that only a concrete group could be the object of genuinely moral commitments, however, such collaboration became the only means to the realization of higher moral goals. And it was the function of the school — the public, state-supported, secular school — to create and maintain the individual’s attachment to such groups.

如何解决由此产生的悖论ーー即社会的具体客观性与真正道德目标的客观性之间的明显矛盾？涂尔干的回答是，无论这些目标多么理想和客观，我们都应该通过我们所属的最具体、最明确的群体——即现代民族国家——来追求这些目标。实际上，这意味着国家不应该在军事、政治或经济上扩张，损害邻国的利益，而应该关注本国公民的物质和道德福祉。这种内在的、“向心的”爱国主义ーー与第三共和国早期的殖民主义政策完全不同ーー不需要掩盖这些社会独特的民族特征。法国天才的“清晰和独特的想法”可能会因此与德国人的口味复杂的实际经验，以实现更高的人性本身。31迪尔凯姆的信念，只有一个具体的群体可以是真正的道德承诺的对象，然而，这种合作成为唯一的手段，以实现更高的道德目标。而学校的功能ーー这是一所公立、国家支持的世俗学校ーー是为了创造和维持个人对这些群体的依恋。

Durkheim’s treatment of these two elements of morality was thoroughly and determinedly realist; and it was social realism that resolved an apparent contradiction between them. Everyone distinguishes these two elements in morality — i.e., the word more typically used to describe the first, formal element was “duty,” while the content of moral acts was treated by moralists under the concept of the “good.” But there was also a tension and even opposition between them, in so far as Kantians and rationalists habitually deduced the good from the imperative nature of moral commands, while utilitarians and empiricists frequently derived the sense of duty of the desirability of the consequences of morally obligatory acts. With his typical, scholastic enthusiasm for the resolution of antinomies, it is not surprising to hear Durkheim insist that his conception of society as the sole, necessary and suf®cient object of moral conduct contained a means ± indeed, the only means ± that would resolve this apparent contradiction. Very briefly, “duty” and the “good” were simply two, equally appropriate ways of speaking of the same concrete reality — i.e., society. “There are certainly few if any men,” Durkheim insisted, “who are able to do their duty for the sole reason that it is their duty and without having at least some vague sense that the prescribed act is in some respect good - in a word, without being disposed to it by the same natural inclination of their feelings.” Conversely, although society “may be within us and although we merge partially with it, when we act morally the collective ends we pursue are so far beyond us that in order to succeed to their heights - to go beyond ourselves to this extent - an effort is generally required of which we would be incapable were it not for the idea of duty, the feeling that we ought so to act, that we are obliged to do so, which re-enforces and sustains our commitment to the group” (1961: 99). So there is no genuinely moral act which is not guided by “duty” and the “good.”

迪尔凯姆对这两种道德要素的处理是彻底而坚定的现实主义; 正是社会现实主义解决了它们之间明显的矛盾。每个人在道德上都区分这两个要素ーー也就是说，用来描述第一个正式要素的词更为典型的是“责任”，而道德行为的内容则由道德家在“善”的概念下处理但他们之间也存在着紧张甚至对立，因为康德主义者和理性主义者习惯性地从道德命令的命令性质中推断出善，而功利主义者和经验主义者则经常从道德义务行为的后果的可取性中获得责任感。迪尔凯姆对解决矛盾有着典型的学术热情，他坚持认为社会是道德行为的唯一、必要和足够的客体，这个概念包含着一种手段，事实上，这是解决这个明显矛盾的唯一手段。简而言之，“责任”和“善”只是两种同样恰当的方式来描述同一具体现实ーー即社会。迪尔凯姆坚持说: “当然很少有人能够仅仅因为这是他们的职责而履行他们的职责，而且他们至少没有一些模糊的感觉，认为规定的行为在某些方面是好的——换句话说，没有受到他们感情的自然倾向的影响。”相反，尽管社会“可能在我们内部，尽管我们部分地与它融合，但当我们在道德上行动时，我们追求的集体目标远远超出了我们的能力范围，以至于为了达到他们的高度——超越我们自己到这种程度——我们通常需要一种努力，如果不是因为责任的概念，一种我们应该这样做的感觉，一种我们有义务这样做的感觉，一种强化和维持我们对集体的承诺的努力”(1961:99)。因此，没有一种真正的道德行为是不受“责任”和“善”的指导的

This antinomy resolved, however, Durkheim recognized that these constituted distinguishable “types” of morality - e.g., the disposition for discipline predominating among some individuals, and an expansive affection characterizing others. And what is true of individuals is equally true of societies, an observation that Durkheim probably drew from Saint-Simon’s distinction between “critical” and “organic” periods, but which also evokes Weber’s distinction between the authority of “priests” and that of “prophets.” When a society achieves a stage of stability and equilibrium, Durkheim suggested, a preference for rule and order is predominant; but in periods of rapid social change, this spirit of discipline is less pronounced, and the need for some ideal, for an object of sacrifice and devotion, comes to the fore.

然而，这种矛盾得到了解决，迪尔凯姆认识到，这些构成了可区分的道德“类型”——例如，在一些个体中占主导地位的纪律性倾向，以及其他个体所特有的广泛的情感。个人的真理同样适用于社会，涂尔干的观察可能来自圣西蒙对“批判”和“有机”时期的区分，但这也唤起了韦伯对“牧师”和“先知”的权威的区分迪尔凯姆认为，当一个社会达到一个稳定和平衡的阶段时，对规则和秩序的偏好占了主导地位; 但在社会快速变革的时期，这种纪律精神就不那么明显了，对于牺牲和奉献的对象的某种理想的需要就变得突出起来。

The important point here - and one consistently ignored where “externality” and “constraint” are depicted as the essential features of social facts - is that Durkheim clearly saw his own century as a period of the latter type, one in which the spirit of discipline had declined naturally and dramatically, and in which a more affective, emotional morality was both appropriate and, in any case, required. It was this recognition, of course, which dictated his prescriptions for the moral education of the children of the Third Republic. Above all else, Durkheim emphasized, “the capacity for giving, for devoting one’s self, should be stimulated and nourished. It is necessary to involve individuals in the pursuit of great collective ends to which they can devote themselves; to train them to cherish a social ideal, for the realization of which they may some day work’’ (1961: 102). Quite aside from its admittedly important role in social regulation, it was this integrative function that religion had performed admirably over the centuries. God was not simply an authority to whom we had obligations. In addition, God was an ideal to which we aspired, whose image we attempted to realize in our own lives. Recognizing this, Durkheim insisted, we need only substitute an empirically observable reality — society — for God, and the nature and authority of moral rules is entirely de-mystified.

这里重要的一点——一直被忽视的一点是，“外部性”和“约束”被描述为社会事实的本质特征——迪尔凯姆清楚地看到，他自己的世纪是后一种类型的时期，在这个时期，纪律的精神自然而然地急剧下降，在这个时期，一种更加情感化的情感道德既是适当的，而且在任何情况下都是必需的。当然，正是这种认可，决定了他对第三共和国儿童的道德教育的处方。最重要的是，涂尔干强调，“给予的能力，奉献自己的能力，应该得到刺激和滋养。有必要让个人参与到追求伟大的集体目标的过程中，这样他们就可以全身心地投入其中; 训练他们珍惜一个社会理想，为了实现这个理想，他们有一天可能会努力工作”(1961:102)。除了在社会规范方面公认的重要作用之外，几个世纪以来，宗教令人钦佩地发挥了这种综合作用。上帝不仅仅是一个我们有义务的权威。此外，上帝是我们向往的理想，我们试图在自己的生活中实现上帝的形象。认识到这一点，涂尔干坚持认为，我们只需要用一个经验观察到的现实ーー社会ーー来代替上帝，道德规则的本质和权威就完全不再神秘。

It is a principle of the modern mind, Durkheim continued, that no “predetermined mode of thought’’ should be “arbitrarily imposed on us’’; on the contrary, both logic and ethics dictate that “our reason should accept as true only that which it itself has spontaneously recognized as such’’ (1961: 107—8). This more recent principle — the autonomy of the individual — could emerge only in the context of a more rational, secular society; but it was no less fundamental an axiom in the moral education of the child, despite its apparent dishar mony with the more traditional elements of morality, and particularly with the spirit of discipline. There are few passages in Durkheim’s writings where he more directly and selfconsciously confronted Kant: “[N]o one has felt more strongly . . . the imperative quality of the moral law,’’ Durkheim observed, “[yet Kant] refuses to acknowledge that the will can be completely moral when it is not autonomous, when it defers passively to a law of which it is not the maker’’ (1961: 108—9). Kant’s solution to this paradox depended on his own conception of the duality of human nature. Briefly, Kant insisted that autonomy is the product of the will which — were it not subordinated to the senses and were it instead constituted of pure impersonal reason — would incline us naturally to duty. But the will is not so constituted, and thus we require a law of reason (the categorical imperative) by which to guide our will and restrain our senses. Pure reason, therefore, is itself autonomous. Our moral obligations are the consequence of the law imposed by this reason, in conjunction with the will, on the inferior aspects of our nature.

迪尔凯姆继续说道，这是现代心智的一个原则，即“预定的思维模式”不应该“任意强加于我们”; 相反，逻辑和伦理都要求“我们的理性应该只接受它自己自发承认为真的东西”(1961:107ー8)。这个较新的原则ーー个人的自主权ーー只能在一个更理性、更世俗的社会背景下出现; 但它同样是儿童道德教育中的一条基本公理，尽管它显然与较传统的道德要素，特别是与纪律精神不一致。在涂尔干的著作中，几乎没有哪个章节能够让他更直接、更自觉地直面康德: “没有人比他更强烈地感受到... ... 道德法则的命令性质,”涂尔干评论道，“(但康德)拒绝承认，当意志不是自主的时候，当它被动地服从于它不是其创造者的法则时，它可以是完全道德的。”(1961年: 108ー9)。康德对这一悖论的解决依赖于他自己对人性二重性的概念。简而言之，康德坚持认为，自治是意志的产物，如果意志不从属于感官，而是由纯粹的非人格理性构成，它就会自然地使我们倾向于义务。但是意志并不是这样构成的，因此我们需要一个理性法则(定言令式)来引导我们的意志并约束我们的感官。因此，纯理性本身是自主的。我们的道德义务是由这个理由和意志强加于我们本性的劣势方面的法律的结果。

As we have seen, Durkheim’s conception of human nature was no less dualistic; but Kant’s transcendental idealism, Durkheim complained, left the obligatory character of moral rules unexplained. Reason itself being autonomous, Kant’s formulation endowed the moral law with authority only in its conflict with the passions. But Durkheim insisted that the moral law is invested with an authority that imposes deference even upon the reason. “We do not only feel that it dominates our senses,’’ he argued, “but our whole nature, even our rational nature’’ (1961: 109—10). Important in its own right, the argument further indicates how completely Durkheim considered his theory of knowledge — one of his most enduring contributions to modern sociology — as subordinate to and derived from his theory of morality. “Our whole nature has the need to be limited, contained, restricted,” Durkheim argued, “our reason as well as our senses. For our reason is not a transcendent faculty; it is implicated in society and consequently conforms to the laws of society’’ (1961: 110). If the autonomy which Kant would grant us is logically possible, Durkheim thus concluded, “[it] has not and never will have anything to do with reality.’’ Human nature comprising both the reason and the senses, we will constantly be at war with ourselves, and hetero-nomy “will always be the rule in fact if not by right.’’

正如我们所看到的，迪尔凯姆的人性概念同样具有二元性; 但是，迪尔凯姆抱怨说，康德的先验唯心主义没有解释道德规则的强制性特征。理性本身是自主的，康德的公式赋予道德法只有在它与激情的冲突中才具有权威性。但涂尔干坚持认为，道德法律被赋予了一种权威，它甚至对理性施加顺从。“我们不仅觉得它支配我们的感官,”他争辩道，“而且我们的整个本性，甚至我们的理性本性”(1961:109-10)。这个论点本身就很重要，它进一步表明迪尔凯姆是如何完全地认为他的知识论——他对现代社会学最持久的贡献之一——是从属于他的道德理论的，并且是从他的道德理论衍生出来的。涂尔干认为: “我们的整个本性需要受到限制、包容和限制，我们的理性和感官都是如此。”。因为我们的理性不是一种超然的能力，它与社会有关，因此符合社会的规律”(1961:110)。迪尔凯姆总结道，如果康德赋予我们的自治在逻辑上是可能的，那么“它过去没有，将来也永远不会与现实有任何关系。”人的本性既包含理性，又包含感性，我们将不断地与自己作战，而他律“即使不是正确的，事实上也永远是规律”

Instead of a logical autonomy, therefore, Durkheim demanded an effective, progressive autonomy — something assured only by science. In so far as we understand the laws of things — i.e., why things are the way they are — we need no longer conform to these laws out of external, physical constraint, because we are incapable of doing otherwise; on the contrary, we now conform voluntarily, because it is good to do so, and because we have no more rational alternative. “Such conformity does not amount to passive resignation,’’ Durkheim insisted, “but to enlightened allegiance. Conforming to the order of things because one is sure that it is everything it ought to be is not submitting to a constraint. It is freely desiring this order, assenting through an understanding of the cause’’ (1961: 115). But this “science’’ which yields an understanding of these laws is not the product of individual, Cartesian reason, any more than individual, Cartesian reason created the laws which science understands; rather, science is the collective activity dreamed of by Bacon, in which one aspect of nature (society) progressively comprehends another (the physical world).[32](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark43) This same, collective activity also extended to understanding of the laws of society. By investigating the degree to which the moral order is founded in the nature of things (i.e., the nature of society), we learn the extent to which it is as it ought to be, to which it is “normal” rather than “pathological.” And in so far as it is normal, we “freely” (i.e., knowledgeably and consciously) conform to this moral order. “To act morally,” Durkheim repeated, “it is not enough - above all, it is no longer enough - to respect discipline and to be committed to a group. Beyond this . . . we must have knowledge, as clear and complete an awareness as possible of the reasons for our conduct” (1961: 120).

因此，迪尔凯姆要求的不是逻辑上的自主，而是一种有效的、渐进的自主ーー这种自主只有科学才能保证。只要我们理解事物的规律ーー也就是事物为什么会这样ーー我们就不再需要出于外部的物理约束而遵守这些规律，因为我们没有能力做其他的事情; 相反，我们现在是自愿遵守的，因为这样做是好的，因为我们没有更理性的选择。涂尔干坚持说: “这种顺从并不等于被动的顺从，而是开明的效忠。遵循事物的顺序，因为一个人确信它是它应该是的一切，这就是不服从一个约束。它自由地渴望这种秩序，通过对原因的理解而赞同”(1961:115)。但是这种“科学”产生了对这些规律的理解，它不是个人的，笛卡尔理性的产物，也不是个人的，笛卡尔理性创造了科学所理解的规律; 相反，科学是培根梦想的集体活动，在这种集体活动中，自然(社会)的一个方面逐步理解另一个方面(物理世界)。同样，集体活动也延伸到了对社会规律的理解。通过调查道德秩序在多大程度上建立在事物的本质(即社会的本质)上，我们了解道德秩序在多大程度上是应该的，在多大程度上是“正常的”而不是“病态的”只要这是正常的，我们就“自由地”(即，有知识和有意识地)遵循这种道德秩序。迪尔凯姆重复道: “仅仅遵守道德是不够的——最重要的是，现在已经不够了——尊重纪律，忠于集体。除此之外... ... 我们必须有尽可能清晰和完整的认识，了解我们行为的原因”(1961:120)。

This third element of morality played an important role in Durkheim’s political and professional interests. With morality dehned in this way, for example, it was clear that moral education could no longer be entrusted to the Church. For the Church taught morality by preaching and indoctrination, insisting that the de-mystihcation of the origin of moral rules was not only sacrilegious, but undermined morality itself. But if, as Durkheim would have it, autonomy assumed a position parallel to duties and ideals in the dehnition of moral facts, morality had to be taught by explaining the reasons for things, the causes underlying the particular duties of individuals and groups, and the specihc ideals which emerged at certain stages of social evolution. The original element in Durkheim’s argument is not his insistence that this could be done, but rather his insistence that it could be done without diminishing the dignity and authority of moral rules; on the contrary, as an element of morality itself, the rational comprehension of the reasons for moral rules and ideals became a condition of virtuous conduct itself. And this rational comprehension was the function, not of the Church, but of the school, and, more particularly, of the nascent but rapidly growing discipline of sociology.

这第三个道德要素在涂尔干的政治和职业利益中发挥了重要作用。例如，随着道德以这种方式被剥夺，很明显，道德教育不能再委托给教会。因为教会通过布道和灌输来教导道德，坚持道德规则起源的去神秘化不仅是亵渎，而且破坏了道德本身。但是，如果像涂尔干认为的那样，自主性在道德事实的界定上采取了与义务和理想平行的立场，那么道德就必须通过解释事物的原因、个人和群体特定义务背后的原因以及在社会进化的某些阶段出现的特定理想来传授。涂尔干论证的原始要素不是他坚持这可以做到，而是他坚持这可以做到而不削弱道德规则的尊严和权威; 相反，作为道德本身的一个要素，对道德规则和理想的理性理解成为道德行为本身的一个条件。这种理性的理解，不是教会的功能，而是学校的功能，更具体地说，是社会学这门新兴但发展迅速的学科的功能。

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORALITY in THE CHILD

儿童道德的发展

Consistent with his ethical relativism and advocacy of reform, Durkheim felt that these three elements of morality - the spirit of discipline, the attachment to social groups, and the autonomy of the individual — exist in the child only as the most general predispositions. This is not to say that the child is a tabula rasa. Despite the “inconstancy” of ideas and feelings which the child shares with primitive peoples, for example, his tendency toward habit predisposes him to that behavioral regularity essential to the moral life. Similarly, the child’s vulnerability to suggestion encourages the external imposition of discipline and control.[33](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark44) But these, Durkheim insisted, are mere tendencies, inclinations which might be “crystallized” in one direction or another depending upon subsequent education. This education begins, of course, in the family; but precisely because the modern family is small, intimate, and supports constant interpersonal contact, Durkheim observed, it is unable to inspire any sense of the abstract, impersonal, and immutable character of moral rules. So it is in the school — the public school of the Third Republic — that the child must acquire the Kantian sense of the moral law, learning “to do his duty because it is his duty’’ (1961: 147).

与他的伦理相对主义和改革主张一致，涂尔干认为这三个道德要素——纪律的精神、对社会群体的依附和个人的自主性——只作为最普遍的倾向存在于儿童身上。这并不是说这个孩子就是一张白纸。例如，尽管孩子与原始人有着“不固定”的思想和感情，但他的习惯倾向使他倾向于那种对道德生活至关重要的行为规律。同样，孩子对暗示的脆弱性鼓励了外在的约束和控制。但是，涂尔干坚持认为，这些仅仅是倾向，倾向可能会在某个方向“具体化”，这取决于随后的教育。当然，这种教育始于家庭; 但正是因为现代家庭是小型的、亲密的，并且支持持续的人际交往，涂尔干观察到，它不能激发任何抽象的、客观的、不可改变的道德规则的特征。因此，在学校ーー第三共和国的公立学校ーー孩子必须学会康德的道德法则，学会“因为这是他的责任而尽他的责任”(1961:147)。

For Durkheim, therefore, the discipline of the school was far more than simply a necessary condition for learning. On the contrary, it was learning itself, a part of the moral education of the child, and the inter mediary between the affective morality of the family and the more rigorous ethic of civil society. “It is by respecting the school rules,’’ Durkheim insisted, “that the child learns to respect rules in general, that he develops the habit of self-control and restraint simply because he should control and restrain himself. It is a first initiation into the austerity of duty. Serious life’’ — the phrase Durkheim later used to characterize the religious life — “has now begun’’ (1961: 149). Since it is through the teacher that these rules are revealed to the child, such individuals must themselves be decisive and self-disciplined; but above all, they must have a priestlike belief in the greatness of their task — a comparison that deserves a lengthy quotation:

因此，对涂尔干来说，学校的纪律远不止是学习的必要条件。相反，它是学习本身，是儿童道德教育的一部分，是家庭情感道德和公民社会更严格道德之间的中介。涂尔干坚持认为: “正是通过尊重学校的规则，孩子学会了尊重一般的规则，他养成了自我控制和克制的习惯，仅仅是因为他应该控制和克制自己。”。这是第一次开始紧缩的责任。“严肃的生活”ーー涂尔干后来用来描述宗教生活的短语ーー“现在已经开始了”(1961:149)。因为这些规则是通过老师告诉孩子的，这些人自己必须是果断和自律的; 但最重要的是，他们必须对自己任务的伟大有一种神父般的信念ーー这种比较值得引用一段长长的话:

It is the priest’s lofty conception of his mission that gives him the authority that so readily colors his language and bearing. For he speaks in the name of a God, who he feels in himself and to whom he feels himself much closer than the laymen in the crowds he addresses. So, the lay teacher can and should have something of this same feeling. He also is an instrument of a great moral reality which surpasses him and with which he communicates more directly than does the child, since it is through his intermediation that the child communicates with it. Just as the priest is the interpreter of God, [the lay teacher] is the interpreter of the great moral ideas of his time and country. Whatever is linked with these ideas, whatever the signi®cance and authority attributed to them, necessarily spreads to him and everything coming from him since he expresses these things and embodies them in the eyes of children. (1961: 155)

正是神父崇高的使命观赋予了他权威，使他的语言和举止显得如此优美。因为他以上帝的名义说话，他感觉上帝在他自己里面，他感觉上帝和他自己比他所面对的人群中的外行人更亲近。因此，非专业教师可以而且应该有一些相同的感觉。他也是一个伟大的道德现实的工具，超越了他，他比儿童更直接地与之交流，因为儿童是通过他的中介与之交流的。正如牧师是上帝的诠释者一样，外行教师也是他那个时代和那个国家伟大道德观念的诠释者。任何与这些思想有关的东西，任何赋予它们的意义和权威，都必然会传播给他，传播来自他的一切，因为他表达了这些东西，并在孩子们的眼中体现了这些东西。(1961:155)

A noteworthy feature of this discussion is that Durkheim had described both the nature of school discipline and the authority of the teacher without mentioning the idea of punishment or reward. This deliberate oversight is particularly interesting in light of Durkheim's criticism, in L’Evolution pedagogique, of the Jesuits' introduction of rewards and prizes into education, which resulted in a “blatantly immoral'' emphasis on individualism and competition (1961: 261—2). “Sanctions,” Durkheim here again asserted, “do not have the preponderant role sometimes assigned to them in the development of the spirit of discipline” (1961: 157). As he had been in De la division du travail social, however, Durkheim was convinced that there could be no rule without a corresponding sanction, and that the latter must thus in some way assist in the functioning of the former (1984: 28—9).

这次讨论的一个值得注意的特点是，迪尔凯姆描述了学校纪律的性质和教师的权威，但没有提到惩罚或奖励的想法。这种故意的疏忽在迪尔凯姆的《进化教育学》中尤其有趣，他批评耶稣会士在教育中引入奖励和奖励，这导致了对个人主义和竞争的“公然不道德”的强调(1961:261ー2)。涂尔干在这里再次断言，“在纪律精神的发展中，制裁并不具有有时赋予它们的主导作用”(1961:157)。然而，正如迪尔凯姆在社会工作分工中所做的那样，他确信，没有相应的制裁，就不会有规则，因此，后者必须以某种方式协助前者的运作(1984:28ー9)。

What, then, is the proper role of sanctions — especially punitive sanctions — in the discipline of the school? The “preventive” theory, Durkheim observed, depends upon the mental association formed between the idea of an anticipated action and that of the suffering expected to follow from it, so that the fear of the latter prevents the performance of the former. But punishment, Durkheim objected, “acts from the outside and on externals,'' and “cannot touch the moral life at its source''; even if effective as a constraint on disruptive impulses, it could never be a “moralizing instrument” (1961: 161). In short, what Durkheim wanted was less the student's obedience than the fulfillment of his duty, something he felt could never be assured of by punishment conceived and implemented as a deterrent. This raised the alternative, “expiatory” theory, which suggested that the role of punishment is atonement, nullifying the offense and its consequences, and restoring things to their previous state of equilibrium. The difficulty with this theory, as Durkheim acknowledged, was that it made punishment simply another form of retaliation, repaying suffering with further suffering, evil with evil — a principle “no longer acceptable to the contemporary moral conscience.”[34](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark45) But what renders punishment efficacious, Durkheim insisted, is not the suffering that accompanies it; rather, it is the respect for the authority of moral rules which it restores. Moral rules, in short, are sacred things, endowed with intangible qualities of prestige, force, and energy; and the violation of such rules with impunity renders them vulgar and profane, resulting in the “demoralization” of the collective conscience. For Durkheim, therefore, the function of punishment was indeed expiation; but the instrument of this expiation was less suffering than the restoration of the faith in sacred things.

那么，制裁(尤其是惩罚性制裁)在学校纪律中的适当作用是什么？迪尔凯姆观察到，“预防性”理论依赖于预期行动的想法和预期随之而来的痛苦之间形成的精神联系，因此对后者的恐惧阻碍了前者的实施。但是迪尔凯姆反对，惩罚“来自外部和外部的行为”，并且“不能触及道德生活的源头”; 即使作为一种对破坏性冲动的有效约束，它也永远不可能成为一种“道德工具”(1961:161)。简而言之，迪尔凯姆想要的与其说是学生的服从，还不如说是履行他的职责，他觉得作为一种威慑而构思和实施的惩罚永远无法保证这一点。这提出了另一种“赎罪”理论，认为惩罚的作用是赎罪，使犯罪及其后果无效，并使事物恢复到以前的平衡状态。正如迪尔凯姆所承认的，这一理论的难点在于，它使惩罚成为另一种形式的报复，用更多的痛苦来报复痛苦，以恶报恶ーー这一原则“不再为当代道德良知所接受”34但是涂尔干坚持认为，使惩罚有效的不是伴随惩罚而来的痛苦，而是对道德规则的权威的尊重。简而言之，道德规则是神圣的东西，具有无形的威望、力量和能量; 违反这些规则而不受惩罚，使它们变得庸俗和亵渎，导致集体良知的“道德败坏”。因此，对涂尔干来说，惩罚的作用的确是赎罪; 但是这种赎罪的工具比起恢复对神圣事物的信仰来说，更少的痛苦。

The expiatory function of punition sans souffrance thus affirmed, Durkheim turned to the more practical question of how this punishment should be applied in the school. The question raised serious difficulties for Durkheim, for as an educational realist, he was committed to the notion that children should learn under the influence and discipline of “natural things.” Indeed, other writers similarly committed had already questioned whether any “artificial” discipline should be introduced in the school at all. In Emile, of course, Rousseau had argued that, at least until the age of twelve, punishment should simply allow misconduct to bring on its own natural consequences (1979: 77—163). Spencer, arguing on more utilitarian grounds, had extended the same theory to the child's later, moral education. An action whose consequences were beneficial and pleasurable was “good,” Spencer insisted, while one whose consequences were maleficent and painful was “bad”; and since bad actions would thus quite naturally produce painful consequences for the child, and the memory of those consequences would surely prevent the recurrence of such actions, the goal of moral education could be reduced to eliminating all arti®cial factors which might prevent the child from experiencing the natural consequences of his conduct (1961: 169—70). And Durkheim was also aware of the school for peasants established by Tolstoy at Yosnaya Polyana in 1859, which was predicated on the assumption that the natural condition for learning was freedom, and that the only pedagogical method was ®rst-hand experience. Inspired by Emile, Tolstoy had insisted that children be allowed to come and go as they pleased, following the “natural bent” of their curiosity, and that no constraints, formulas, dogmas, or “civilized” values be imposed upon them.

迪尔凯姆由此肯定了无痛苦惩罚的赎罪功能，并转向更为实际的问题，即这种惩罚应该如何适用于学校。这个问题给涂尔干带来了严重的困难，因为作为一个教育现实主义者，他坚信孩子们应该在“自然事物”的影响和约束下学习事实上，其他同样致力于此的作家已经质疑学校是否应该引入任何“人为的”学科。当然，在《埃米尔》一书中，卢梭主张，至少在12岁之前，惩罚应该只是允许不当行为自然产生后果(1979:77ー163)。斯宾塞从功利主义的角度出发，将同样的理论延伸到了孩子以后的道德教育上。斯宾塞坚持认为，一个后果是有益和愉悦的行为是“好的”，而一个后果是有害和痛苦的行为是“坏的”; 因为坏的行为会自然而然地给孩子带来痛苦的后果，而记住这些后果肯定会防止这种行为的再次发生，道德教育的目标可以降低到消除所有人为因素，这些因素可能会阻止孩子体验他的行为的自然后果(1961:169-70)。涂尔干也知道托尔斯泰于1859年在 Yosnaya Polyana 建立的农民学校，这个学校的前提是学习的自然条件是自由，唯一的教学方法是亲身经历。受埃米尔的启发，托尔斯泰坚持让孩子们按照他们好奇心的“自然倾向”来去自如，不要强加任何约束、公式、教条或“文明”价值观。

Durkheim was attracted to each of these examples of education under the influence of “natural things.” But the realism of Rousseau’s theory extended only to the physical education of the child, after which the artificial intervention of the teacher became necessary (1961: 168-9). Spencer’s focus on the consequences of actions seemed a better long-term foundation for the moral life than a respect for authorities whose influence might later be avoided, while punishment derived from “the nature of things,’’ following “naturally and necessarily” from actions, possessed precisely that quality of impersonality that Durkheim considered essential to the moral law. But there was no immediately apparent connection between a phenomenon and its cause, Durkheim objected, so that the child — like the primitive - was unlikely consistently to attribute present sufferings to the appropriate transgressions of the past; and this dif®culty was exacerbated in advanced industrial societies, where the temporal and spatial “distance” between acts and their negative consequences was far greater than in their primitive counterparts.[35](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark46) Most important, Spencer’s theory ignored the purpose of school discipline itself, which was less to establish associations between speci®c acts and their consequences than to inculcate the habit of self-discipline for later life. It was the habit of self-discipline, not speci®c actions, whose consequences were bene®cent; and the injurious consequences of misdeeds were not limited to the specific consequences of acts, but extended to the subversion of the rules they violated and denied. Since these consequences would become evident only long after the child left the school, it was necessary for the teacher to intervene at an early stage, linking sanctions to rules in a manner that artificially anticipated those of later life (1961: 173, 179). And Tolstoy’s theory was simply “contrary to everything we know of history.’’ People learn not from the love of knowledge, but because their societies impose the duty or obligation of learning upon them. “What man has done only through a sense of duty from the beginning of history,” Durkheim concluded, “the child can do only through a sense of duty as he enters into life” (1961: 181).

涂尔干被这些在“自然事物”影响下的教育的例子所吸引但是卢梭理论的现实主义仅仅延伸到对儿童的体育教育，在此之后，教师的人为干预变得必要(1961:168-9)。斯宾塞对于行为后果的关注似乎是道德生活的一个更好的长期基础，而不是对权威的尊重，后者的影响力可能会被避免，而源于“事物的本质”的惩罚，在“自然和必然”的行为之后，恰恰具有涂尔干认为对于道德法则至关重要的客观品质。但是涂尔干反对说，一种现象和它的起因之间没有立即明显的联系，所以孩子——像原始人一样——不太可能一贯地把现在的痛苦归因于过去的适当的过错; 这种不同的邪教在先进的工业社会中更加严重，在那里，行为和它们的负面后果之间的时间和空间“距离”远远大于原始人。最重要的是，斯宾塞的理论忽视了学校纪律本身的目的，学校纪律本身并不是建立特定行为和它们的后果之间的联系，而是为以后的生活灌输自律的习惯。这是一种自律的习惯，而不是具体的行动，其后果是有益的; 不法行为的伤害性后果不限于行为的具体后果，而是延伸到对它们违反和否认的规则的颠覆。由于这些后果只有在孩子离开学校很久之后才会变得明显，所以教师有必要在早期阶段进行干预，将制裁与规则联系起来，人为地预测以后的生活(1961:173,179)。而托尔斯泰的理论只是“与我们所知的历史背道而驰”人们学习不是因为热爱知识，而是因为他们的社会强加给他们学习的责任或义务。迪尔凯姆总结道: “从历史开始，人类只有通过责任感才能做到的事情，孩子只有在进入生命的过程中通过责任感才能做到。”(1961:181)。

Nonetheless, Durkheim considered the underlying principle of these three theories ± that punishment should be the natural consequence of the act, not something arti®cially imposed upon it ± incontestable. The original element in Durkheim’s theory was his realist insistence that society was itself a part of nature, that the disapproval and reproach provoked by antisocial behavior was thus education “under the influence of natural things,’’ and that rules and laws did no more than codify, organize, and systematize these spontaneous societal reactions. Punishment, therefore, was only the means to an end, that of giving the child “the most vivid impression possible of the feeling evoked by his behavior,’’ of “reaffirming the obligation at the moment when it is violated, in order to strengthen the sense of duty, both for the guilty party and for those witnessing the offense — those whom the offense tends to demoralize” (1961: 182). For this purpose, corporal punishment — a product of the medieval school — was unnecessary. In the public school of the Third Republic, therefore, corporal punishment was to be absolutely forbidden, a posture consistent with the “religious” respect for the person found in more advanced societies. In short, the “natural” reproach of society was sufficient to instill the first element of morality — the spirit of discipline — in the child.

尽管如此，涂尔干认为这三种理论的基本原则是: 惩罚应该是行为的自然结果，而不是人为强加于行为的某种东西。涂尔干理论的原始要素是他的现实主义坚持认为，社会本身就是自然的一部分，反社会行为所引起的反对和谴责就是“在自然事物的影响下”的教育，而规则和法律只不过是将这些自发的社会反应编纂、组织和系统化。因此，惩罚只是达到目的的手段，给孩子“他的行为所引起的感觉的最生动的印象”，“在责任被违背的那一刻重申义务，以加强责任感，不管是对有罪的一方还是那些目睹犯罪的人ーー那些犯罪倾向于使士气低落的人”(1961:182)。为了达到这个目的，体罚ーー中世纪学校的产物ーー是没有必要的。因此，在第三共和国的公立学校里，体罚是绝对禁止的，这种姿态与更先进社会中对人的“宗教”尊重是一致的。简而言之，社会的“自然”谴责足以向孩子灌输道德的第一要素ーー纪律的精神。

Durkheim insisted that the second element of morality — the attachment to social groups — was no more “innate” than the first, and this in turn led him to a discussion of the distinction between “egoistic” and “altruistic” tendencies.[36](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark47) In ordinary usage, he suggested, the distinction is found between those tendencies whose goal is the pleasure of the agent (egoism) and those whose goal is the pleasure of some other person (altruism), an antithesis so sharp as to make it inconceivable that both had the same origin. Thus we discover the source of egoism in the “natural constitution of man,’’ that selfish human nature epitomized in the child and the savage, while the origin of altruism is found in the artificial, relatively belated influences of culture and civilization. This distinction between egoism and altruism acknowledged, and their separate causes admitted, the function of moral education could only be to introduce and develop those altruistic dispositions initially lacking in the child.

涂尔干坚持认为，道德的第二个要素ーー对社会群体的依恋ーー并不比第一个要素更“天生”，这反过来又导致他讨论了“利己主义”和“利他主义”倾向之间的区别。他认为，在通常的用法中，这种区别存在于那些目的是为了主体(利己主义)的快乐的倾向和那些目的是为了他人(利他主义)的快乐的倾向之间，这是一个如此尖锐的对立面，以至于不可思议地认为两者有着同样的起源。因此，我们发现利己主义的根源在于“人的自然构成”，自私的人性集中体现在儿童和野蛮人身上，而利他主义的根源则在于人为的、相对迟来的文化和文明的影响。利己主义和利他主义之间的这种区别得到了承认，它们各自的原因也得到了承认，道德教育的作用只能是引进和发展儿童最初缺乏的那些利他主义倾向。

Adamantly and simultaneously, Durkheim resisted the distinction, the separation of causes, and the function of education this distinction and separation implied. The goal of altruistic tendencies, for example, is not always some other person(s), but may extend to abstract ideals (e.g., the scholar's disinterested pursuit of knowledge) whose value is disproportionate to any utilitarian consequences their realization might secure. There are also disinterested, utterly unsel-®sh tendencies (e.g., the feuds between kin groups) whose object is to give pain rather than pleasure to others. And there are sel®sh, compulsive dispositions (e.g., those of alcoholics, kleptomaniacs, and anorexics) whose goal can hardly be described as the pursuit of pleasure. Man does not seek pleasure, Nietzsche once observed, only the Englishman does that. In an only slightly less anti-utilitarian mood, Durkheim insisted that any distinction between egoistic and altruistic tendencies derived from differences in the kinds of pleasures they pursued was simply incoherent.

同时，迪尔凯姆坚决反对这种区分、原因的分离以及这种区分和分离所暗示的教育功能。例如，利他主义倾向的目标并不总是某些其他人，而是可能延伸到抽象的理想(例如，学者对知识的无私追求) ，其价值与他们的实现可能确保的任何功利主义后果不成比例。还有一些无私的、完全无私的倾向(例如，亲属团体之间的不和) ，其目的是给别人带来痛苦而不是快乐。还有一些强迫性的性格(例如，酗酒者、盗窃狂和厌食症患者) ，他们的目标很难被描述为追求快乐。尼采曾经说过，人不寻求快乐，只有英国人才这样做。迪尔凯姆的反功利主义情绪略有减弱，他坚持认为，任何区分利己主义倾向和利他主义倾向的做法，都源于他们所追求的各种快乐的差异，这种区分简直是不连贯的。

How, then, are we to distinguish between egoistic and altruistic actions? Durkheim's answer was that we should focus on the kinds of objects to which we are attached. At times, for example, these objects are simply aspects of ourselves (e.g., our bodies, our health, our reputations), in which case the attachment for them might reasonably be called “centripetal” or egoistic - i.e., directed toward the self. At other times, our tendencies are “centrifugal” or altruistic — i.e., directed toward objects outside of us (e.g., family, friends, occupational groups, country, morality), which have an existence independent of our own. But neither tendency, Durkheim insisted, is more or less “natural” than the other, nor does altruism (as the utilitarians claimed) derive from a more enlightened egoism. On the contrary, our attachment for things external presupposes their representations within us. The “sel®sh human nature” epitomized in children and savages — and here again the presence of Rousseau is palpable — is simply the consequence of their weaker, less expansive ®eld of consciousness, for both egoism and altruism have deep roots in our nature.

那么，我们如何区分利己主义行为和利他主义行为呢？涂尔干的回答是，我们应该关注我们所依附的对象的种类。例如，有时候，这些对象只是我们自己的一些方面(例如，我们的身体，我们的健康，我们的名声) ，在这种情况下，对它们的依恋可以合理地被称为“向心”或利己主义——也就是说，直接针对我们自己。在其他时候，我们的倾向是“离心的”或利他的ーー也就是，指向我们以外的对象(例如，家庭、朋友、职业群体、国家、道德) ，它们有一个独立于我们自己的存在。但涂尔干坚持认为，这两种倾向或多或少都不比另一种倾向“自然”，利他主义(正如功利主义者声称的那样)也不是来自更加开明的利己主义。相反，我们对外在事物的依恋预先假定了它们在我们内心的表现形式。“自私的人性”在儿童和野蛮人身上体现得淋漓尽致——这里卢梭的存在也是显而易见的——这只是他们意识范围较弱、不那么广阔的结果，因为利己主义和利他主义都深深植根于我们的本性。

This alternative distinction in turn yielded a strategy for stimulating the altruistic sentiments so crucial to the Third Republic. For us to be attached to a social group, Durkheim had suggested, means to have the representation of that group (irmly within us, so that it “is a part of our consciousness,” and “cannot disappear without creating a painful void.'' The creation of this attachment was essentially a matter of conditioning ± i.e., it was essential to repeat this representation to the child again and again, to link it with other ideas of a similar nature, and to embellish it with enough color, force, and life to stimulate action. As always, Durkheim was adamant in his insistence that moral education was not a matter of theory, reason or speculation; rather, it was a matter of action, will, and emotion:

这种另类的区分反过来又产生了一种激发对第三共和国至关重要的利他主义情绪的战略。涂尔干曾建议，对于我们来说，依附于一个社会群体，意味着拥有这个群体的代表(牢牢地在我们内部，这样它“就是我们意识的一部分”，并且“不能在不造成痛苦空虚的情况下消失”这种依恋的产生本质上是一个条件作用的问题，也就是说，必须一遍又一遍地向孩子重复这种表征，把它与其他类似性质的想法联系起来，并用足够的颜色、力量和生命来加以润色，以刺激行动。涂尔干一如既往地坚持道德教育不是理论、理性或投机的问题，而是行动、意志和情感的问题:

[B]y broadening gradually the consciousness of the child so as to infuse it with the idea of the social groups to which he belongs and will belong, by linking, through repetition, these ideas intimately with the greatest possible number of other ideas and feelings, so that the former are constantly called to mind and come to occupy such an important place in the child's mind that he will resist any diminution or weakening of them; by communicating them with such warmth and sincerity that their emotive power becomes an active force; by developing that power of action through exercise ± such is the general method we must follow to commit the child to the collective goals that he must pursue. (1961: 229±30)

通过不断地重复，把这些想法与尽可能多的其他想法和感受紧密地联系起来，逐渐地扩大孩子的意识，使之注入他所属和将要属于的社会群体的想法，这样，前者就会不断地出现在孩子的头脑中，占据重要的位置，以至于他会抵制这些想法的任何减少或削弱; 通过如此温暖和真诚的交流，使他们的情感力量成为一种积极的力量; 通过锻炼来发展行动的力量，这是我们必须遵循的一般方法，使孩子致力于他必须追求的集体目标。(1961:229 ± 30)

The twin vehicles of this method of moral conditioning were to be the school environment itself and the content of its teachings. Discussing the ®rst, Durkheim articulated his vision of the public school as an inter mediary between the family and the state. More extensive than the family and based upon a fortuitous gathering of subjects by age rather than ties of blood, the school remained suf®ciently small to allow intimate personal relationships to crystallize. Indeed, it was only through such associations that societies larger than the family had ever become possible. As such, the school was a “precious instrument,” the natural successor to those societes intermediates - the province, commune, and guild ± whose authority had been destroyed by the centralizing policies of the monarchy and then the Revolution. The lack of such associations in France, Durkheim argued, constituted a “serious crisis,” contrasting sharply with the student life he had observed during his travels of 1885-6. “In Germany,” he observed,

这种道德调节方法的双重载体是学校环境本身及其教学内容。在讨论前者时，涂尔干阐述了他的公立学校作为家庭和国家之间的中介的愿景。学校比家庭范围更广，而且基于偶然聚集的学科年龄而不是血缘关系，学校仍然相当小，允许亲密的个人关系明确化。事实上，只有通过这样的协会，比家庭更大的社会才成为可能。因此，学校是一个“宝贵的工具”，是那些社会中介——省、公社和行会——的自然继承者，而这些社会中介的权威已经被君主制的中央集权政策以及后来的革命所摧毁。迪尔凯姆认为，法国缺乏这种联系构成了“严重的危机”，与他在1885-1886年的旅行中所观察到的学生生活形成了鲜明对比。“在德国,”他说,

everything is done in a group. People sing together. They take walks together. They play together. They philosophize together, or talk about science and literature. All kinds of associations, corresponding to every kind of human activity, function in parallel ways; thus, the young man is constantly involved in group life. He engages in serious occupations in a group, and he relaxes in a group.[37](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark48)

所有的事情都是在一个小组里完成的。人们一起唱歌。他们一起散步。他们一起玩。他们一起哲学思考，或者谈论科学和文学。各种各样的联想，与人类的各种活动相对应，以平行的方式发挥作用; 因此，年轻人不断地参与群体生活。他在一群人中从事严肃的职业，在一群人中放松。37

In France, by contrast, the principle was that of the isolated individual, resistant to the group and hostile to its obligations and restrictions. Durkheim acknowledged a more recent renaissance of intermediate associations in French life ± e.g., commercial and industrial organizations, scienti®c societies, student groups, even movements toward the administrative decentralization of the towns and provinces. For the most part, however, he treated these as “legal artifacts,” external arrangements revealing a need, but not yet corresponding to deeply held feelings. “The central fact,” he insisted, “is that [these intermediate associations] cannot become living realities unless they are willed, desired, demanded by grassroots sentiment ± in other words, unless the spirit of association comes alive, not only in a few educated circles, but in the deep mass of the population” (1961: 238).

相比之下，在法国，原则是孤立的个人，抵制集体，敌视集体的义务和限制。迪尔凯姆承认最近法国生活中中间协会的复兴，例如，商业和工业组织，科学社团，学生团体，甚至向城镇和省的行政地方分权的运动。然而，在大多数情况下，他把这些作为“合法的工艺品”，外部安排揭示了一种需要，但尚未对应于深深持有的感情。他坚持认为: “最核心的事实是，除非这些中间协会是基层情绪的意愿、期望和要求，否则它们不可能成为活生生的现实，换句话说，除非协会精神不仅在少数受过教育的圈子里，而且在广大人民群众中活跃起来”(1961:238)。

To instill this “spirit of association” ± so palpable among German university students of the 1880s ± was the special function of the public school of the Third Republic: “[A]t this decisive time,” Durkheim said, referring to the child’s first steps beyond the home, [i]f the child . . . is carried along in the current of social life, the chances are strong that he will remain oriented in this way throughout his life. If he develops the habit of expressing his interests and activities in various groups, he will keep the habit in his post-school life; and then the action of the lawmaker will really be fruitful, for it will emerge from soil that education will have prepared. This is what accounts for the tremendous social significance of the school today. (1961: 239)

为了向19世纪80年代的德国大学生灌输这种“联合精神”，第三共和国(Third Republic)公立学校的特殊功能是: “在这个决定性的时刻,”迪尔凯姆表示。他指的是孩子跨出家门的第一步，如果孩子... ... 顺应社会生活的潮流，他很有可能在一生中都保持这种方向。如果他养成了在各种团体中表达自己兴趣和活动的习惯，那么他将在毕业后的生活中保持这种习惯; 那么立法者的行动将真正富有成效，因为它将从教育准备好的土壤中脱颖而出。这就是为什么今天这所学校具有巨大的社会意义。(1961:239)

The teacher must thus “lie in wait for everything” ± e.g., a common emotion which grips the class upon reading a touching piece of literature, a shared moral judgment passed upon some historical character, etc. ± that might lead the class “to sense their unity in a common enterprise.” Such events occurring, the teacher must crystallize the resulting sentiments in the more durable, symbolic form of easily remembered precepts, maxims, and proverbs. The collective life of the class should be emphasized by sanctions that reward and punish the group rather than the individual, and the record of past awards made palpable to provide the class a sense of history, of enduring through time (1961: 239-48). By such devices, the shallow individualism of the child could be overcome, and his attachment to the group strengthened.

因此，老师必须“等待一切”，例如，一个共同的情感，抓住课堂上阅读一篇感人的文学作品，一个共同的道德判断通过一些历史人物，等等，这可能会导致班级“感到他们在一个共同的事业的统一。”这样的事件发生后，教师必须将由此产生的情感以更持久、更易于记忆的戒律、格言和谚语的符号形式具体化。这个阶级的集体生活应该通过奖励和惩罚群体而不是个人的制裁来强调，而且过去的奖项记录可以让这个阶级感受到历史，感受到历史的持久(1961:239-48)。通过这些手段，孩子们浅薄的个人主义可以被克服，他们对集体的依恋也会增强。

Quite aside from the moral environment of the classroom, however, there was the content of its teachings, a topic that allowed Durkheim to expand the critique of Cartesian rationalism begun in L'Evolution pedagogique. “[W]e understand things,” Durkheim began, referring specihcally to the French intellect, “in proportion as they are simple,” while the complex “can be conceptualized only in a murky and confused way.” From this followed the quite natural tendency to deny any reality to complex things, to view their apparent complexity as the product of our intellectual limitations, and to reduce them to their simpler elements. This tendency was epitomized in Descartes, for whom the secondary qualities of matter — e.g., form, color, sound, etc. — were illusory, while mathematical extension constituted reality itself. Cartesianism, Durkheim then explained, “is deeply rooted in our national thinking; it has become one of the characteristic traits of the French mind, at least until recent times.” Every Frenchman is “to some degree a conscious or unconscious Cartesian. The need to distinguish and clarify, which characterizes our national temper, inclines us to turn away from anything too complex to be easily and clearly conceptualized; and that which we are inclined not to see and not to look at is something we are naturally inclined to deny” (1961: 253—4). The French language itself is “analytical,” well suited to reduction, simplicity, and abstraction, but inadequate when faced with the depth and complexity of a Faust or a Hamlet.

然而，除了课堂的道德环境之外，还有教学的内容，这个话题使涂尔干扩大了对笛卡尔理性主义的批判，这种批判始于进化教育学。涂尔干特别提到了法国知识分子，开始说: “我们理解事物的比例因为它们是简单的,”而复杂的事物“只能以一种模糊和混乱的方式被概念化。”由此产生了一种相当自然的倾向，即否认复杂事物的任何现实性，将其表面上的复杂性视为我们智力局限的产物，并将其简化为更简单的元素。这种倾向在笛卡尔身上得到了集中体现，对笛卡尔来说，物质的第二性质ーー例如形式、颜色、声音等ーー是虚幻的，而数学的延伸构成了现实本身。迪尔凯姆接着解释说，笛卡尔主义“深深植根于我们的民族思想; 它已经成为法国人思想的特征之一，至少在近代以前是如此。”每个法国人“在某种程度上都是有意识或无意识的笛卡尔主义者。区分和澄清的需要，是我们国家性格的特征，使我们远离任何过于复杂的东西，以至于难以容易和清晰地概念化; 而那些我们倾向于不去看和不去看的东西，是我们自然倾向于否认的东西”(1961:253ー4)。法语本身是“分析性的”，非常适合还原、简洁和抽象，但是当面对浮士德或哈姆雷特的深度和复杂性时就不够了。

This was not the prolegomena to a general critique of rationalism, for Durkheim consistently defended the central postulate of a rationalist education — i.e., that nothing in the nature of things was irreducibly irrational. But for Durkheim, there were things in nature that were rational and also irreducibly complex. One element of this belief — as we will see in chapter 3 (see pp. 153—60) — lay in Boutroux's notion of discontinuous levels of being, each displaying an element not present in its predecessor, and thus irreducible to it. For Boutroux, this anti-reductionist view provided a solution for the classic French problem of freedom versus determinism, the evolution of consciousness introducing the new, irreducible level of mind. For Durkheim, it provided an infrastructure for a realist interpretation of society. If complex wholes were reducible to their constituent parts, then only the individual was real, and society was a mere mental construct; and a mental construct, Durkheim was quick to observe, can never be the object of our moral allegiance. “It would be absurd,” he insisted, “to sacrifice the real, concrete, and living being that we are to a purely verbal artifact. We can only dedicate ourselves to society if we see in it a moral power more elevated than ourselves” (1961: 257).

这不是对理性主义的一般性批判的序言，因为涂尔干一贯捍卫理性主义教育的中心假设ーー即，事物的本质中没有什么是不可减少的非理性。但对涂尔干来说，自然界中有些东西是理性的，也是不可简化的复杂。这种信念的一个要素ーー正如我们将在第三章(见第153-60页)中看到的ーー在布特鲁克斯的存在不连续层次的概念中，每个层次都表现出一个在其前身中不存在的要素，因此不可还原为它。对布特鲁克斯来说，这种反还原主义的观点为法国经典的自由与决定论问题提供了一个解决方案，意识的进化引入了新的、不可还原的思想水平。对涂尔干来说，它为现实主义者解释社会提供了基础。如果复杂的整体可以简化为它们的组成部分，那么只有个体是真实的，社会仅仅是一个心理构造; 而心理构造，涂尔干很快观察到，永远不可能成为我们道德忠诚的对象。“这将是荒谬的,”他坚持，“牺牲真正的，具体的，我们是一个纯粹的口头艺术品活着。我们只有在社会中看到一种比我们自己更高尚的道德力量，我们才能把自己奉献给社会”(1961:257)。

To “shake this simplistic prejudice” and “give the child a sense of the real complexity of things” was thus the goal of a truly moral education. The means to this end was to teach the child how science is constructed; and here Durkheim clearly meant not mathematics, but the experimental sciences:

因此，“摆脱这种过于简单化的偏见”和“让孩子感受到事物的真正复杂性”是真正道德教育的目标。达到这一目的的手段是教孩子如何构建科学; 在这里，涂尔干显然不是指数学，而是指实验科学:

To forestall simplistic thinking, it is . . . necessary first to give the child a defense against these constructions and deductions. The child must be brought to see how science is studied; how the labor, time and trouble that study entails contrasts with such deductive improvisations . . . In short, we must convey the need for experimentation, for observation, and the necessity of getting out of ourselves and submitting to the teachings of experience. (1961: 262—3)

为了防止过分简单化的想法，首先... 有必要给孩子一个对这些结构和推理的辩护。必须带孩子去看看科学是如何被研究的; 研究所需要的劳动、时间和麻烦与这种即兴演绎形成了鲜明的对比... ... 总之，我们必须传达实验、观察的需要，以及走出自我、服从经验教导的必要性。(1961:262ー3)

This was Durkheim’s response to those more mystical, irrationalist thinkers who insisted on the essential amorality of science, and advocated a more aesthetic education reminiscent of the Renaissance. The study of art and literature, Durkheim insisted, “makes us live in an imaginary environment,’’ and should thus assume only a secondary, accessory role in education. By contrast, the study of the physical and biological sciences — far from being amoral — could play a role in the formation of moral character, for their study prepared the child for an understanding of the real complexity of the natural, empirical world — including society. Scientific education — by teaching us not only about nature, but about our place within nature — could be morally edifying.

这是涂尔干对那些更加神秘、非理性主义的思想家的回应，他们坚持科学的本质非道德性，并提倡一种让人想起文艺复兴的更加美学的教育。迪尔凯姆坚持认为，对艺术和文学的研究“使我们生活在一个想象的环境中”，因此在教育中应该只扮演次要的、辅助的角色。相比之下，物理科学和生物科学的研究(远非不道德的)可以在道德品质的形成方面发挥作用，因为它们的研究使孩子能够理解自然、经验世界(包括社会)的真正复杂性。科学教育ーー不仅通过教我们关于自然，而且通过教我们关于我们在自然中的位置ーー可以在道德上有所启迪。

The “whole man’’ required by the Third Republic, therefore, was very different from the man which had satis®ed the needs of earlier societies. Faced with the seductions of an increasingly materialistic world, for example, this new man must control his desires and accept limitations; but this respect for the “spirit of discipline” would come not from the ruthless suppression of nature dictated by some abstract, absolute rule, but from respect for society — itself a natural thing — so that the acceptance of its demands would be the ful®llment rather than the violation of nature. In sharp contrast to traditional societies, which depend upon habit and custom to secure obedience, and even to more recent societies, which depend on the categorical imperative or the “greatest happiness” principle, the man of the Third Republic would thus need to know why society makes these demands - in short, to understand the social causes underlying the moral constraints to which he submits himself. Durkheim explained the renunciation of individual interest traditionally implied by submission to the group in the same manner -i.e., since our “most important” interests have their origin in society, subjecting private to public interests can never be a violation of the self, but rather its enlightened fulfillment; and here again, “enlightenment” meant a sociologist’s understanding of the source of group demands. Finally, this same sociological understanding of “why things are the way they are’’ provided Durkheim’s answer to the problem of freedom and autonomy - i.e., in so far as we understand the laws of things, we conform to them, not out of external, physical constraint, but voluntarily, because it’s the good and rational thing to do. Freedom, in short, is a product of the rational understanding of the laws of nature.

因此，第三共和国所要求的“完整的人”与满足早期社会需要的人是非常不同的。例如，面对日益物质化的世界的诱惑，这个新人类必须控制自己的欲望，接受限制; 但这种对“纪律精神”的尊重，并非来自某种抽像的绝对统治对自然的无情压制，而是来自对社会的尊重ーー社会本身就是一种自然的东西ーー这样，接受社会的要求，就是对自然的全面控制，而不是对自然的违背。与传统社会形成鲜明对比的是，传统社会依赖习惯和习俗来确保服从，甚至与更近一些的社会形成鲜明对比，后者依赖于定言令式或“最大幸福”原则，因此，第三共和国的人需要知道社会为什么提出这些要求——简而言之，需要了解他屈从于的道德约束背后的社会原因。迪尔凯姆用同样的方式解释了放弃个人利益的传统含义，即服从于群体——也就是说，由于我们“最重要”的利益源于社会，因此让私人利益服从于公共利益永远不会是对自我的侵犯，而是对其开明的实现; 在这里，“启蒙”意味着一个社会学家对群体需求来源的理解。最后，这种对“为什么事物是这样的”的社会学理解为迪尔凯姆提供了对自由和自治问题的答案——也就是说，只要我们理解事物的规律，我们就会遵从它们，不是出于外部的物理约束，而是自愿的，因为这是好的和理性的事情。简而言之，自由是理性地理解自然法则的产物。

Taken together, L'Evolution pedagogique and L'Education morale help us to place Durkheim within the larger context of anticlerical educational reform described in chapter 1. We have seen, for example, that many of the anticlericals had a reluctant admiration for the system of moral influence they were proposing to destroy, combined with some vision of a secular religion for the Third Republic. Durkheim seems to have shared both the admiration and the vision, without the reluctance, praising the Christian - indeed, Jesuit - idea of education as a kind of gradual conversion which would effect the transformation of the “whole man’’ of the future. The eudaemonic ethics of antiquity, revived by the Renaissance, was dismissed in favor of the more austere, Christian conception of duty. This was combined with strong criticism of the Renaissance and Enlightenment ideal of literary, philosophical education, as well as an insistence that laicization must not only remove the supernatural, but replace it with the scientific study - not of books or of style - but of things.

综上所述，“进化教育学”和“教育士气”帮助我们把涂尔干置于第一章所描述的反教会教育改革的大背景下。例如，我们已经看到，许多反教权主义者不情愿地钦佩他们打算摧毁的道德影响力体系，加上对第三共和国世俗宗教的某种愿景。涂尔干似乎同时赞赏和愿景，没有不情愿，赞扬基督教——实际上，耶稣会——的教育观念作为一种渐进的转变，将影响未来“整个人”的转变。由于文艺复兴而复兴的古代的幸福伦理学，被更为严格的基督教义务概念所取代。这与对文艺复兴和启蒙运动文学、哲学教育理想的强烈批判相结合，同时坚持认为，俗化不仅必须消除超自然现象，而且必须用科学研究——不是对书籍或风格的研究——而是对事物的研究——来取代超自然现象。

The same two works provide a fairly complete picture of what I have described as Durkheim’s “social realist’’ vocabulary. At the center of that vocabulary, of course, was the notion that social phenomena are things rather than ideas; but in his typical manner, Durkheim reinforced this initial distinction with several other dichotomous pairs, each isomorphic with the ®rst. Social things are concrete, for example, while ideas are abstract. Social phenomena are also more complex, where ideas are simple. Society is conceived, not only as “similar to” nature, but as itself a real, natural thing, apart of nature, and subject to its laws, in sharp contrast to the formulations of Hobbes and Rousseau, which made society a product of art. Deductive inferences drawn logically from ®rst principles are repeatedly rejected in favor of inductive generalizations based on careful observations and experimentation (or, where experiments are impossible - as in some of the social sciences - systematic comparisons). And this in turn reflects Durkheim’s ambivalence to — and occasional, searing hostility for — Descartes, combined with his embrace-ment of the Baconian educational reforms of Comenius. Most important, things that are concrete and complex provide “solid, consistent and resilient objects’’ — i.e., objects with the power to limit and constrain the anomic and egoistic forces of bourgeois individualism, as well as the capacity to secure the moral allegiance and veneration of future generations of French citizens. These were things that simple and abstract ideas could never do.

同样的两个作品提供了一个相当完整的画面，我所描述的迪尔凯姆的“社会现实主义”词汇。当然，这些词汇的中心是社会现象是事物而不是思想的概念; 但是在他的典型方式中，涂尔干用其他几个二分法对加强了这个最初的区别，每个二分法对与第一个二分法对同构。例如，社会事物是具体的，而思想是抽象的。社会现象也更为复杂，思想也更为简单。社会不仅被认为是“类似”自然的，而且它本身也是一个真实的、自然的东西，是自然的一部分，受自然法则的支配，这与霍布斯和卢梭的观点形成了鲜明的对比，后者认为社会是艺术的产物。从第一原理得出的逻辑推理被反复拒绝，而倾向于基于仔细观察和实验的归纳推论(或者，在实验不可能的情况下——如在一些社会科学中——进行系统比较)。这反过来反映了迪尔凯姆对笛卡尔的矛盾心理，以及他对夸美纽斯的培根式教育改革的支持。最重要的是，具体和复杂的事物提供了“坚实、一致和有弹性的对象”ーー也就是说，这些对象有能力限制和约束资产阶级个人主义的失范和自私的力量，以及有能力确保未来几代法国公民的道德忠诚和尊敬。这些是简单而抽象的想法永远做不到的事情。

The course of lectures that became L’Education morale has recently been dated to 1898—9 — i.e., immediately after the publication of Le Suicide (1897) (Besnard 1993: 127). This is important, because Durkheim’s treatment of the “spirit of discipline” and the “attachment to social groups’’ develops the same ideas found in his 1897 discussion of regulation and integration, respectively. In the earlier work, of course, insufficient or excessive regulation and/or integration provided the theoretical scaffolding on which Durkheim’s explanation of variable suicide rates was grounded. But in the lectures on moral education, Durkheim gave us a clearer sense of the social and political interests and purposes that this realist conception of social facts was contrived to serve. In the earlier work, Durkheim spoke qua sociologist, “discovering” social things. In the latter work, he spoke qua educational reformer, pointing to the pragmatic value of this particular vocabulary — i.e., of speaking and thinking of social phenomena as if they were real things.

最近成为 L‘ Education 士气的演讲课程可以追溯到1898年9月，也就是紧接着《自杀》(1897)出版之后(Besnard 1993:127)。这一点很重要，因为迪尔凯姆对“纪律精神”和“对社会群体的依恋”的处理，发展了他在1897年关于规范和整合的讨论中发现的相同观点。当然，在早期的工作中，不充分或过度的监管和/或整合提供了理论支架，迪尔凯姆对可变自杀率的解释是建立在这个基础上的。但在关于道德教育的讲座中，涂尔干让我们更清楚地认识到，这种对社会事实的现实主义概念是为了服务于社会和政治利益和目的。在早期的作品中，迪尔凯姆称自己是社会学家，“发现”社会事物。在后一部作品中，他以教育改革者的身份发言，指出了这一特定词汇的实用价值ーー也就是说，把社会现象当作真实的事物来谈论和思考。

The same passages provide occasional hints of the sources on which Durkheim drew in “cobbling together’’ this vocabulary. But we still have no clear sense of when and where Durkheim, the philosophy agrege, became “Durkheim,” the social theorist and powerful exponent of social and educational realism. Was it during his studies with Fustel and Boutroux at the Ecole Normale Super-ieure? Was it through his early, independent reading of writers like Renouvier? Or should we take seriously the recent suggestion that he was influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer (1788—1860)? How important was Durkheim’s visit to Germany in 1885—6? As we shall see, the recent discovery of a much earlier set of lectures — given by Durkheim at the Lycee de Sens in 1883—4 — can help us to find more plausible, concrete answers to these questions.

同样的段落偶尔提供了迪尔凯姆“拼凑”这个词汇的来源的提示。但是，我们仍然没有清楚的感觉，什么时候和地方涂尔干，哲学同意，成为“涂尔干”，社会理论家和强大的倡导者的社会和教育现实主义。是在他和福斯特尔、布特鲁克斯一起在“高等师范学校”学习的时候吗？是通过他早期对雷诺维尔这样的作家的独立阅读吗？或者，我们是否应该认真对待最近有关他受到亚瑟·叔本华(1788-1860)影响的说法？1885年6月涂尔干对德国的访问有多重要？正如我们将看到的，最近发现的一套更早的讲座ーー迪尔凯姆于1883年在 Lycee de Sens 举办的讲座ーー可以帮助我们找到这些问题更可信、更具体的答案。

第三章
 
## The perfection of personality 人格的完美
 
Until quite recently, accounts of the “early” Durkheim typically began with a discussion of his review essays of 1885. During the summer of 1995, however, a routine inventory of the papers of the French philosopher Andre Lalande (1867—1964), recently acquired by the Sorbonne, uncovered a detailed, meticulous set of notes covering eighty lectures (almost 600 pages in length), and bearing the inscription: “E. Durkheim — Cours de philosophie fait au Lycee de Sens en 1883—4.” The content of these lectures — almost all of them given in 1883 — reveals a Durkheim so dramatically different from the one with whom we are familiar that he might reasonably be described as the “earlier” Durkheim. Most important for our purposes, this earlier Durkheim was in no sense a social realist — in fact, he seems to have possessed no sociological sensibilities whatsoever — and thus provides us with a starting point from which to answer some of the questions just raised. But first, it will be useful to understand the larger context of the philosophy class itself, and its role in the development of the French intellect.

直到最近，关于“早期”涂尔干的记述通常都是从讨论他1885年的评论文章开始的。然而，在1995年夏天，一份法国哲学家安德烈 · 拉兰德(Andre Lalande，1867-1964)论文的例行清单，最近被 Sorbonne 收购，发现了一套详细、细致的笔记，涵盖了80场讲座(近600页) ，上面刻着: “迪尔凯姆ーー1883年在森斯中学开设的哲学课程ーー4。”这些讲座的内容——几乎都是在1883年讲的——揭示了一个与我们所熟悉的迪尔凯姆截然不同的迪尔凯姆，他可能被合理地描述为“早期的”迪尔凯姆。对于我们的目的来说，最重要的是，早期的涂尔干在任何意义上都不是一个社会现实主义者ーー事实上，他似乎没有任何社会学上的敏感性ーー因此为我们提供了一个出发点，从而可以回答刚才提出的一些问题。但首先，理解哲学课本身的大背景，以及它在法国知识分子发展中的作用，将是有益的。

VICTOR cousin AND THE CLASSE DE PHILOSOPHIE

VICTOR 表亲和哲学课

The mark by which one could recognise a Frenchman, Theodore Zeldin once observed, was not his appearance or his language, but “something much deeper and much subtler: the way he used language, the way he thought, the way he argued” (1977: 205). In his Fragments d'un journal intime (1883—7), the literary critic Henri-Frederic Amiel (1821 —81) thus wrote:

西奥多 · 泽尔丁(Theodore Zeldin)曾经说过，一个人能够认出一个法国人的标志不是他的外表或者他的语言，而是“一些更深层次、更微妙的东西: 他使用语言的方式，他思考的方式，他辩论的方式”(1977:205)。文学评论家亨利-弗雷德里克 · 阿米尔(1821-81)在他的《时间碎片》(1883-7)中写道:

The French always place a school of thought, a formula, convention, a priori arguments, abstraction, and artificiality above reality; they prefer clarity to truth, words to things, rhetoric to science . . . They understand nothing though they chop logic about everything. They are clever at distinguishing, classifying, perorating, but they stop at the threshold of philosophy . . . They emerge from description only to hurl themselves into precipitate generalisations. They imagine they understand man in his entirety, whereas they cannot break the hard shell of their personalities, and they do not understand a single nation apart from themselves. (Zeldin 1977: 205)

法国人总是把一个学派的思想、一个公式、一个惯例、一个先验的论点、抽象和人为置于现实之上; 他们喜欢清晰胜于真理，喜欢言语胜于事物，喜欢修辞胜于科学... ... 他们什么也不懂，尽管他们对一切都斩断了逻辑。他们很擅长辨别、分类、演绎，但他们只停留在哲学的门槛上... ... 他们从描述中脱颖而出，只是把自己投入到突然的概括之中。他们想象自己完全了解人类，但他们无法打破自己个性的坚硬外壳，除了自己，他们不了解任何一个国家。(泽尔丁1977:205)

As we have seen, these were among the qualities of mind that Durkheim hoped to displace with a more concrete preoccupation with things; and the institution responsible for “developing, instilling, and defending these qualities” was the “crowning glory” of the French secondary school system - i.e., the classe de philosophie. In fact, French schools distinguished themselves from those in most of Europe by teaching philosophy to children, and teaching it in a special way — i.e., not as a technical discipline, but as a general survey of the whole of life, bringing together the disparate information the child had already accumulated into a meaningful, coherent synthesis. The classe de philosophie both culminated and completed the student's secondary education, preparing him for the baccalaureat examination so crucial to a university education and almost every professional career. It was in the philosophy class, therefore, that that French acquired “their characteristic abstract and pompous vocabulary, their skill in classification and synthesis, in solving problems by rearranging them verbally, their rationalism and scepticism — paradoxically conformist — and their ability to argue elegantly and apparently endlessly” (Zeldin, 1977: 217, 207).

正如我们所看到的，这些是迪尔凯姆希望用更具体的专注来取代的心灵品质之一; 负责“发展、灌输和捍卫这些品质”的机构是法国中学系统的“最高荣耀”——也就是哲学课。事实上，法国的学校与欧洲大部分地区的学校不同，它们向儿童教授哲学，并以一种特殊的方式教授哲学ーー即不是作为一门技术学科，而是作为对整个生活的一般性调查，将儿童已经积累的各种不同的信息汇集成一个有意义的、连贯的综合体。哲学课程的高潮和完成学生的中学教育，准备他的学士学位考试是至关重要的大学教育和几乎每一个职业生涯。因此，正是在哲学课上，法国人学会了“他们特有的抽象和浮夸的词汇，他们在分类和综合方面的技巧，他们通过口头重新安排问题来解决问题，他们的理性主义和怀疑主义ーー矛盾的墨守成规者ーー以及他们优雅而明显无休止的辩论能力”(Zeldin，1977:217,207)。

The philosophy class had been born in the fifteenth century, when the schools, reacting against the deficiencies of the medieval universities and their clerical preoccupation with theology, began introducing young students to a broader subject matter. But only the best, most prosperous schools had the resources to develop independent philosophical doctrines or methods of their own, so that philosophy remained firmly within the medieval tradition; and in this tradition, Zeldin agrees with Durkheim, “arguments were cultivated for their own sake, not from an interest in truth; a complete lack of intellectual curiosity was easily compatible with this verbal fencing; books existed mainly as arsenals of arguments” (1977: 207—8). Zeldin emphasizes the tenacity of this tradition throughout the subsequent history of French secondary education. In the Renaissance, as we have seen, philosophy became less fashionable than literature and rhetoric — an emphasis Durkheim characterized as the preeminence of style; but during the Enlightenment, while the mere professeur de philosophie had sunk to the status of a contemptible pedant, the philosophe emerged in “a new guise, as a man of the world who could discuss all subjects ± a generalist rather than a specialist ± who appealed to common sense and to all classes, and who was at home equally in literature, science and art'' (1977: 2o8±9). The philosophe, of course, added a crucial element of rational dissent, challenging inherited ideas and institutions in the name of reason and science; but if this mild form of rebellion aptly characterized the posture of Voltaire, D'Alembert and Diderot, it hardly described their followers, who imitated their forms of argument in “studiously conformist ways.'' Before the Restoration, however, “philosophy” was the preoccupation of only a handful of people, taught in no more than sixty schools, only eleven of which had enough pupils to distribute prizes. The subsequent, dramatic change in the status and significance of philosophy was largely the work of Victor Cousin (1792±1867).

哲学课诞生于15世纪，当时的学校针对中世纪大学的缺陷和他们对神学的专注，开始向年轻学生介绍一个更广泛的主题。但是，只有最好的、最繁荣的学校才有资源发展自己独立的哲学教义或方法，这样哲学才能牢牢地保留在中世纪的传统中; 在这一传统中，泽尔丁同意涂尔干的观点，“争论是为了自己的目的而培养的，而不是出于对真理的兴趣; 完全缺乏知识的好奇心很容易与这种口头上的围墙相容; 书籍主要是作为争论的武器存在的”(1977:207ー8)。泽尔丁强调了这一传统在随后的法国中等教育历史中的顽强性。正如我们所看到的，在文艺复兴时期，哲学变得不如文学和修辞那么流行——涂尔干将这种强调描述为风格的卓越; 但在启蒙运动时期，当仅仅是一个哲学教授已经沦为一个可鄙的学究的地位时，哲学家以“一种新的伪装出现了，作为一个能够讨论所有主题的世界人士，而不是一个能够诉诸常识和所有阶层的专家，并且在文学、科学和艺术方面一视同仁”(1977:2o8 ± 9)。当然，哲学家增加了理性异议的关键因素，以理性和科学的名义挑战继承的思想和制度; 但是如果这种温和的反叛形式恰当地描述了伏尔泰、 D‘ Alembert 和狄德罗的姿态，那么它很难描述他们的追随者，他们以“刻意遵从的方式”模仿他们的论证形式然而，在复辟之前，“哲学”只是少数人关注的问题，他们在不超过60所学校教书，其中只有11所学校有足够的学生来分发奖品。随后，哲学的地位和意义发生了戏剧性的变化，这在很大程度上归功于维克多 · 库辛(1792 ± 1867)的著作。

Born the son of a Parisian watchmaker, Cousin attended the Lycee Charlemagne and then joined the first class of the Ecole Normale Superieure, where he studied with a disciple of Condillac, Pierre Laromiguiere (1756—1837), and established a brilliant reputation.1 He began lecturing at the Ecole Normale in 1812, and at the Sorbonne in 1815, soon dismissing Condillac's sensationalism under the influence of the idealist and voluntarist psychology of Maine de Biran (1766—1824)[38](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark49) [39](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark50) and Pierre Paul Royer-Collard (1763—1845).[40](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark51) Cousin also studied German philosophy (Kant, Jacobi, and especially Schelling) and, from 1817 to 1820, traveled in Italy and Germany, where he met Schelling and befriended Hegel. Cousin's “eclectic” or “spiritualist” philosophy assumed that such divergent, seemingly irreconcilable systems all contained elements of philosophic truth; but within these systems ± each of them narrow, rigid, and excessive in its own way ± these fragments of truth were inter mingled with numerous errors, from which they had to be extricated according to the broader criterion of “common sense.” The epistemology of Condillac, for example, was extreme in making the human mind a passive effect of external causes, leading to atheism and materialism, and denying French citizens those permanent principles essential to the moral life. The more activist, subjectivist psychology of Schelling and Maine de Biran allowed for religious commitment, but this spiritualism needed to be “balanced” with a rationalist’s insistence on the concrete existence of a real external world (Boas 1967a: 247). Such eclecticism was hardly new — Durkheim would point to antecedents in the New Academy of Carneades (214—129 B.C.), in Cicero (106—43 B.C.), and in Leibniz (1646—1716) — but Cousin had given the school its “method and principles,’’ and applied them in “a stable manner’’ (Durkheim 1884: 8).

表哥出生于巴黎钟表匠的儿子，曾参加查理曼大学公立学院，后来加入高等师范学校第一班，师从康迪拉克的弟子皮埃尔•拉罗米圭埃(Pierre Laromiguiere，1756-1837) ，并建立了辉煌的声誉。他于1812年开始在师范学院讲课，1815年开始在 Sorbonne 讲课，很快在缅因州德比兰(1766-1824)3839和皮埃尔 · 保罗 · 罗耶-科拉德(1763-1845)的理想主义和自愿主义心理学的影响下，驳斥了康迪拉克的耸人听闻的言论。40表哥还学习德国哲学(康德、雅各比，特别是谢林) ，从1817年到1820年，他在意大利和德国旅行，在那里他遇到了谢林，并与黑格尔成为朋友。表哥的“折衷主义”或“唯心主义”哲学假定，这种分歧的，似乎不可调和的系统都包含哲学真理的元素; 但在这些系统中，每个系统都以自己的方式狭窄，僵化，过度。这些真理的片段混杂在许多错误中，必须根据更广泛的“常识”标准从中解脱出来例如，康迪拉克的认识论极端地使人类的心灵成为外部因素的消极影响，导致无神论和唯物主义，并否认法国公民那些对道德生活至关重要的永久性原则。谢林和缅因州德比兰更为活跃的主观主义心理学允许宗教承诺，但这种唯心主义需要与理性主义者坚持真实外部世界的具体存在“平衡”(Boas 1967a: 247)。这种折衷主义并不新鲜ーー迪尔凯姆会指出新卡尼阿德学院(New Academy of Carneades)(公元前214-129)、西塞罗学院(Cicero)(公元前106-43)和莱布尼茨学院(Leibniz)(公元前1646-1716)的先例ーー但是表兄给了学院“方法和原则”，并以“稳定的方式”运用它们(迪尔凯姆1884:8)。

Eclecticism was a philosophical extension of Cousin’s equally conciliatory political views. Joining the doctrinaires, a small but powerful group of moderate, constitutional Royalists led by Royer-Collard and Francois Guizot (1787—1874), Cousin recommended a middle course — ''le juste milieu” — between rabid monarchism and popular sovereignty, and favored a government led by the educated elite. “Just as he considered his philosophy to be the golden mean between sensationalism and idealism,’’ Stock-Morton observes, “so he considered the Charter to be the mean between absolute monarchy and democracy.’’[41](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark52) In 1820, Cousin’s lectures in Paris drew large crowds of liberal students; but in the reaction following the assassination of the Duc de Berry (the heir to the French throne), Cousin was dismissed. He returned to Germany, where he was imprisoned (the nature of the charges has never been clear) and then freed after six months. The doctrinaires did not prosper under the ultra-Royalist Charles X (r. 1824—30); but during the brief liberalization of 1827 — 8, Royer-Collard was able to recall Cousin to the Sorbonne, where his radical reputation — enhanced by the story of his arrest and imprisonment in Germany — again made him a favorite lecturer.

折衷主义是表哥同样和解的政治观点的哲学延伸。卡森加入了教条主义者的行列，这是一个由罗耶-科拉德(Royer-Collard)和弗朗索瓦 · 吉佐(Francois Guizot，1787-1874)领导的温和的宪政保皇派组成的小型但强大的团体，他建议在狂热的君主制和人民主权之间采取一条中间道路，即“正义的环境”，并支持一个由受过教育的精英领导的政府。“正如他认为他的哲学是介于感觉主义和理想主义之间的中庸之道,”斯托克-莫顿观察到，“所以他认为宪章是介于绝对君主制和民主之间的中庸之道。”1820年，卡森在巴黎的讲座吸引了大批自由派学生; 但在法国王位继承人贝里公爵(Duc de Berry)遇刺后，卡森被解雇了。他回到德国，在那里他被监禁(指控的性质从来没有明确) ，然后在六个月后被释放。教条主义者在极端保皇主义者查尔斯十世(1824-30年)的统治下并没有繁荣起来，但是在1827-8年的短暂自由化期间，罗耶-科拉尔得以召回他在 Sorbonne 的表亲，他在那里的激进名声ーー由于他在德国被捕和监禁的故事而得到加强ーー再次使他成为最受欢迎的讲师。

But it was under the July Monarchy (1830—48) that Cousin came to dominate French secondary education. In 1830 he was appointed to the Royal Council of Public Instruction, where he controlled all teaching of philosophy. Shortly thereafter, a tour of schools in Holland and Prussia convinced him that moral instruction should be offered in the schools under the aegis of religion. In 1833, these views were embodied in the ®rst primary education law since the Revolution, presented to the Chambers by Guizot, who was then Minister of Education.[42](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark53) But it was in secondary education ± where philosophy had been under the control of theologians for at least a decade ± that Cousin's contribution to secular moral education was decisive. A charter of 1830 decreed freedom of religion, expressly omitting any special position for the Church; and as the authority of the Church over moral education declined, the provision for a secular alternative became imperative. To the liberals of 1830, Cousin's disciple Paul Janet (1823±gg) later observed, “the establishment of an independent philosophy curriculum was not only the consequence of the secular state; it was at the same time an instrument of propaganda for the principles of secularism.” The goal was “to create a society which rested on common and fraternal principles, without excluding the diversity of opinions and beliefs'' (1885: 217, 475, 281±2; Stock-Morton 1988: 31).

但正是在七月君主制(1830-1848)的统治下，表哥开始统治法国的中等教育。1830年，他被任命为皇家公共教学委员会成员，在那里他控制着所有的哲学教学。此后不久，他参观了荷兰和普鲁士的学校，使他相信在宗教的庇护下，学校应该提供道德教育。1833年，这些观点体现在革命以来的第一部初等教育法中，由当时的教育部长吉佐提交给钱伯斯。但是在中等教育中，卡森对世俗道德教育的贡献起到了决定性的作用，因为哲学已经在神学家的控制下至少十年了。1830年颁布的宪章规定宗教自由，明确省略了教会的任何特殊地位; 随着教会在道德教育方面的权威下降，规定世俗的替代办法变得势在必行。对于1830年的自由主义者来说，表哥的弟子保罗 · 珍妮特(Paul Janet，1823 ± gg)后来评论道: “建立独立的哲学课程不仅是世俗国家的结果，同时也是世俗主义原则的宣传工具。”目标是“建立一个基于共同和兄弟原则的社会，不排除观点和信仰的多样性”(1885:217,475,281 ± 2; Stock-Morton 1988:31)。

Cousin's eclectic philosophy ± as tolerant of the variety of religious confessions as of philosophical positions or political ideologies ± thus became the official philosophy of the July Monarchy, and the classe de philosophie became a required course in the secondary curriculum, and an essential part of the baccalaureat examination. The philosophy teacher, Cousin declared in 1850, “is a functionary in the service of moral order, appointed by the state to cultivate minds and souls'' (Zeldin 1977: 222). Cousin had soon developed a “philosophical army,'' led by the agreges, with “soldiers” in every lycee, whose training and appointment he personally supervised. During their Easter recess, Saint-Hilaire reports, most of them called on him in Paris, where they were questioned about their work, as well as their relations with the local clergy ± a matter on which he placed great importance (Zeldin 1977: 222; Stock-Morton 1988: 31). Cousin developed a syllabus for the classe de philosophie which survived, in its essentials, for one hundred and thirty years; and his own works were

Cousin 的折衷主义哲学像对哲学立场或政治意识形态一样容忍宗教信仰的多样性，因此成为七月君主制的官方哲学，哲学课程成为中学课程的必修课程，也是中学毕业考试的重要组成部分。这位哲学教师，表哥在1850年宣称，“是一位为道德秩序服务的工作人员，由国家指派来培养思想和灵魂”(泽尔丁1977:222)。表哥很快就建立了一支由同龄人领导的“哲学军队”，每个中学生都有“士兵”，他亲自监督这些士兵的训练和任命。据圣希莱尔报道，在复活节休息期间，他们中的大多数人在巴黎拜访了他，在那里，他们被问及他们的工作，以及他们与当地神职人员的关系 ± a 事件，他非常重视(Zeldin 1977:222; Stock-Morton 1988:31)。表哥为哲学课制定了一份教学大纲，这份大纲在本质上保存了一百三十年，他自己的作品也是如此

used as textbooks in the course at least until 1880, when they were supplanted by those of his disciples, including Janet.[43](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark54)

至少在1880年之前，这门课程一直被用作教科书，后来被包括珍妮特在内的门徒所取代。43

Still more important, through his position at the Sorbonne, later as director of the Ecole Normale, and finally (however briefly) as Minister of Education, Cousin was able to professionalize the teaching of philosophy itself, lending it prestige and thus raising it to a position from which philosophers could declare their independence of theology (Stock-Morton 1988: 191 n. 46). Though paid by the state, therefore, philosophy teachers were not “tame propagandists preaching an orthodox doctrine: they valued their security as civil servants, but reacted against the implication of subservience by increasingly assuming independent attitudes” (Zeldin 1977: 222-3). At least until 1880, of course, this was a dangerous game - despite the fact that eclecticism taught little more than common sense and classic texts - as philosophy was continuously under the scrutiny of the religious and political right; and it was especially dangerous under the Second Empire (1852-70), as some of Cousin’s students began to question spiritualist dogma. Amedee Jacques, editor of the Cousinist journal La Liberte de penser, was dismissed for his admitted atheism, as was the philosopher Etienne Vacherot, for suggesting that reason, experience, and faith might ultimately lead to irreconcilable conclusions. Under Napoleon III, a terrified government temporarily abolished philosophy teaching in the schools altogether, but in 1863, when it was restored to the baccalaureat, it was Cousin’s syllabus that was revived.

更重要的是，通过他在 Sorbonne 的职位，后来作为高等师范学院的主任，最后(尽管短暂)作为教育部长，表哥能够专业化的哲学教学本身，借给它的声望，从而提高它的立场，哲学家可以宣布他们的神学独立(斯托克-莫顿1988:191 n. 46)。因此，虽然哲学教师由国家支付报酬，但他们并不是“宣扬正统教义的温顺的宣传者: 他们重视自己作为公务员的安全感，但是通过越来越多地采取独立的态度来反对卑躬屈膝的含义”(Zeldin 1977:222-3)。当然，至少在1880年之前，这是一场危险的游戏——尽管折衷主义教授的不过是常识和经典文本——因为哲学一直处于宗教和政治权利的监督之下; 在第二帝国(1852-70)时期，这尤其危险，因为一些表哥的学生开始质疑唯灵论的教条。阿米迪 · 雅克(Amedee Jacques)是《考辛斯学派》(Cousinist)杂志《思想自由》(La Liberte de penser)的编辑，他和哲学家艾蒂安 · 瓦切罗(Etienne Vacherot)一样，因为认为理性、经验和信仰可能最终导致不可调和的结论而被解雇。在拿破仑三世时期，一个受到惊吓的政府暂时完全废除了学校里的哲学教学，但是在1863年，当哲学教学恢复到高中阶段时，表哥的教学大纲又被重新启用了。

The signi®cance of the philosophy course, both as a prerequisite for the baccalaureat and as a preparation for French citizenship, exposed it to a variety of abuses and criticisms. As a consequence of its unyielding hostility to materialism, for example, Marx was admitted to the syllabus only in 1960. Although it’s starting point was psychology, it typically construed self-knowledge as the consequence of rational reflection, thus resisting any emphasis on the emotions or the unconscious. While its eclectic approach exposed students to a variety of classic texts, the assumption that these texts exhausted all there was to know left it resistant to inventive and creative minds. The manufacture of textbooks and, still worse, model answers to examination questions became a flourishing industry. Finally, as rival disciplines emerged in the secondary syllabus, the traditional supremacy of the classe de philosophie was challenged. Gustave Monod (1844—1912), a historian and founder of the Revue historique in 1876 demanded that philosophy be eliminated from the secondary curriculum altogether, and the psychologist Theodule Ribot (1839—1916), though a philosopher by training, argued that philosophy was too difficult for most secondary students, boring the majority while intoxicating the rest with generalizations and formulae that they could rarely use (Zeldin 1976: 218—19).

哲学课程的重要性，既是中学毕业考试的先决条件，也是法国公民身份的准备，使它受到各种各样的虐待和批评。例如，由于马克思坚决反对唯物主义，他只是在1960年才被接受进入教学大纲。虽然它的出发点是心理学，但它通常将自我认识解释为理性反思的结果，从而抵制了对情感或无意识的任何强调。虽然它的折衷方法使学生接触到各种各样的经典文本，但这些文本耗尽了所有知识的假设使它对创造性和创造性的头脑产生抵制。教科书的制造，更糟糕的是，模拟试题的答案成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。最后，随着竞争学科出现在中学教学大纲中，传统的哲学课的至高无上地位受到了挑战。古斯塔夫 · 莫诺德(1844ー1912)是一位历史学家，也是1876年历史杂志的创始人，他要求从中学课程中完全取消哲学。心理学家西奥杜勒 · 里伯特(1839ー1916)虽然是一位受过训练的哲学家，但他认为哲学对于大多数中学生来说太难了，大多数学生觉得无聊，而其他人则沉醉于他们很少用到的概括和公式(泽尔丁1976:218ー19)。

Still, the Cousinist framework endured into the 1880s, when the philosopher Jules Lachelier (1832—1918), inspector-general in charge of philosophy, conducted the agregation examination on the principle that all that could be said in philosophy had already been said, that there was nothing more to discover or invent, and that teachers should therefore simply present the known facts in a lively manner. Determined to keep them from flirting with new subjects like anthropology or social science, he twice failed Charles Andler (1866—1933), who took the agregation in 1887 and 1888, largely because Lachelier disliked his “excessive bias” toward German philosophy.[44](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark55) Cousin entrenched philosophy so firmly in the schools, Zeldin concludes, “because he deliberately adapted it to the tastes of the middle classes, whom he recognised as being ®rmly conservative in moral attitudes; by making it the most important subject in the final examination of the baccalaureat, he gave it official status as the necessary hallmark of an educated man” (1977: 209—10).

尽管如此，库桑主义的框架一直延续到19世纪80年代，当时哲学家朱尔斯 · 拉切利尔(Jules Lachelier，1832-1918) ，主管哲学的总监，基于这样一个原则进行了总结性的检验: 哲学中所有可以说的都已经说过了，没有什么可以发现或发明的了，因此教师应该以一种生动的方式简单地呈现已知的事实。为了阻止他们与人类学或社会科学这样的新学科调情，他两次让查尔斯 · 安德勒(1866-1933)失望，后者在1887年和1888年进行了合并，很大程度上是因为拉赫利埃不喜欢他对德国哲学的“过度偏见”。44表哥将哲学牢牢地植根于学校，泽尔丁总结道，“因为他故意使哲学适应中产阶级的品味，他认为中产阶级在道德态度上极其保守; 通过使哲学成为中学毕业考试最重要的科目，他赋予了哲学官方地位，作为一个受过教育的人的必要标志”(1977:209-10)。

It was to prepare such “educated men” that Durkheim, having passed his agregation at the Ecole Normale Superieure in 1882, began teaching philosophy at the Lycee de Puy in October. One month later, he moved to the Lycee de Sens, where the philosopher Lalande became his student in the fall of 1883. Lalande would later recall Durkheim as an unusually conscientious teacher, who set an example of “systematic order in investigations and . . . well-organized ideas.” At the end of each lesson, Lalande added, “he turned to the blackboard and reconstructed its plan, composed of titles and short, ordered formulae, which made concrete for his hearers the structure, always precise and well-constructed, of what he had just expounded in a free and continuous passion” (Lukes 1972: 64). Durkheim’s pupils had a great admiration and affection for him, Lalande added, some of them even following him to the Lycee de Saint-Quentin where he moved, in February, 1884, to be closer to his family. Of those who did not, most — including Lalande himself — borrowed notes taken by other students during the preceding year, recopying them in their own hand to complete the full syllabus of eighty lectures (Lukes 1972: 64; Gross 1996). With the exception of a few lectures given in January and early February, 1884, therefore, all of the notes reflect beliefs held by Durkheim in 1883 — easily our earliest, most detailed and complete evidence of his philosophical commitments.[45](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark56)

正是为了培养这样的“受过教育的人”，迪尔凯姆在1882年通过了高等师范学校，于10月开始在 Lycee de Puy 教授哲学。一个月后，他搬到了 Lycee de Sens，1883年秋天，哲学家拉兰德成了他的学生。拉兰德后来回忆说，涂尔干是一位异常尽责的教师，他树立了“调查中的系统秩序和... ... 井然有序的思想”的榜样在每堂课的结尾，拉兰德补充道，“他转向黑板，重新构建了它的计划，由标题和简短有序的公式组成，为他的听众具体化了结构，总是精确和构建良好，他刚刚在一个自由和持续的激情阐述”(卢克斯1972:64)。拉兰德补充说，迪尔凯姆的学生对他非常钦佩和喜爱，有些学生甚至跟随他到了 Lycee de Saint-Quentin，1884年2月，为了离家人更近，他搬到了那里。在那些没有这样做的学生中，包括拉兰德本人在内的大多数人借用了其他学生在前一年所做的笔记，并用自己的手复制这些笔记，以完成80门课程的完整教学大纲(卢克斯1972:64; 格罗斯1996)。因此，除了1884年1月和2月初的几次讲座之外，所有的笔记都反映了涂尔干在1883年所持有的信仰，这很容易成为我们对他的哲学承诺的最早、最详细和最完整的证据

THE SCIENCE OF MIND

心理科学

Philosophy, Durkheim began, is “the science of states of consciousness and their conditions” (1884: 6). Since Durkheim’s students were apparently as unaccustomed as we are to thinking of philosophy as a science, this definition required some elaboration. To be a “science,” Durkheim explained, a system of knowledge must have a distinct object — i.e., one not confused with that of any other science (for philosophy the object is “states of consciousness’’); it must submit this object to the laws of identity or of causality (as we shall see, for philosophy this meant the latter); and it must have a method whereby the object is studied (for philosophy, the experimental method) (1884: 18—19). Durkheim thus dismissed the classical notion that philosophy was a kind of Ur-knowledge from which the other sciences were derived, as well as the Comtean notion that philosophy serves only as the concluding synthesis of positive science. Instead, he insisted that philosophy is an independent science that sustains a variety of relationships with the positive sciences, including the study of laws of knowledge on which they depend, the search for the method most appropriate to each particular science, and so on. Finally, because the states of consciousness studied by philosophy include phenomena of quite different kinds, philosophy itself was subdivided into several more distinct sciences — i.e., psychology, logic, ethics, and metaphysics — which together made up the syllabus that Cousin had designed for the classe dephilosophie.

哲学，涂尔干开始，是“意识状态及其条件的科学”(1884:6)。由于迪尔凯姆的学生显然和我们一样不习惯把哲学当作一门科学来思考，这个定义需要一些阐述。迪尔凯姆解释说，要成为一门“科学”，一个知识体系必须有一个独特的对象——即，一个不与任何其他科学混淆的对象(对哲学而言，这个对象是“意识状态”) ; 它必须使这个对象服从同一性或因果关系的规律(我们将看到，对哲学而言，这意味着后者) ; 它必须有一种研究对象的方法(对哲学而言，是实验方法)(1884:18-19)。因此，迪尔凯姆摒弃了古典哲学是一种乌尔知识，其他科学都是从这种乌尔知识中衍生出来的，也摒弃了孔德的观点，即哲学只是实证科学的结论性综合。相反，他坚持认为哲学是一门独立的科学，它与实证科学有着各种各样的关系，包括研究它们所依赖的知识规律，寻找最适合每一门特定科学的方法，等等。最后，由于哲学所研究的意识状态包括各种各样的现象，哲学本身被细分为几个更加独特的科学ーー即心理学、逻辑学、伦理学和形而上学ーー它们共同构成了表哥为去哲学课设计的教学大纲。

From these introductory lectures, it is clear that in its general outline, Durkheim's conception of science was already well formed by 1883. As a student of Boutroux, for example, Durkheim had already embraced the view that each science has its own object and its own method ± a principle he would further advance and defend in Les Regies (1895). Again, Durkheim had already arrived at the view that logic, ethics, and metaphysics should be grounded in empirical science (albeit in philosophy, not in sociology), and had even embraced the notions of experimental veri®cation introduced by Claude Bernard in 1865. But it's equally clear that, in 1883, Durkheim had no answer to the question of how this conception of science and its method might be applied to the study of social phenomena. Apparently this was because the question itself had not yet occurred to him, for he had not yet conceived of social phenomena in the manner of Alfred Espinas (1844±1922) ± i.e., as part of nature, to be studied comme des choses.

从这些介绍性的讲座中可以清楚地看出，涂尔干的科学概念在1883年之前就已经形成了。例如，作为布特鲁克斯的学生，涂尔干已经接受了这样的观点，即每一门科学都有自己的对象和方法 ± a 原则，他将进一步推进和捍卫《雷吉斯》(1895)。同样，涂尔干已经达到了逻辑学、伦理学和形而上学应该基于经验科学的观点(尽管是在哲学领域，而不是在社会学领域) ，他甚至接受了克劳德 · 伯纳德(Claude Bernard)在1865年提出的实验验证的概念。但同样清楚的是，在1883年，涂尔干没有回答这个科学概念及其方法如何应用于社会现象研究的问题。显然，这是因为他还没有想到这个问题本身，因为他还没有以阿尔弗雷德 · 埃斯皮纳斯(1844 ± 1922) ± 的方式构想出社会现象，也就是说，作为自然的一部分，应该按照事物的本质来研究。

Not surprisingly, this became especially clear when Durkheim turned to the different methods that have been applied in the study of psychological phenomena, and particularly the psycho-physical school of E. H. Weber (1795±1878) and Gustave Fechner (18o1±87). In his Elemente der Psychophysik (1860), Fechner had introduced a mathematical formulation that he called the “law of intensity'' ± i.e., that the intensity of a sensation increases as the logarithm of the stimulus (that is, by diminishing increments) ± to become known as the “Weber±Fechner law,'' considered by some to be the beginning of quantitative experimental psychology (Boring 1950: 293; Ribot 1886: 181±8). The law is important because Durkheim would refer to it again in De la division du travail social (1893), in support of his argument that the human capacity for happiness is limited, and that its pursuit must thus be dismissed as a possible cause for the division of labor (1984: 181±2). But in this fifth Sens lecture, Durkheim dismissed the Weber±Fechner law categorically, on the ground that the body is not simply a passive transmitter of physical excitations to the soul, but rather modihes them significantly, according to the individual and to circumstances (1884: 37). It was to overcome this difficulty, Durkheim added, that Wilhelm Wundt (1832±192o) had established the psycho-physiological school, which related states of consciousness directly to physiological rather than merely physical phenomena. For Wundt, in short, the conscious life of the soul had its roots in the unconscious life of the body. But Durkheim insisted that the soul cannot be reduced to the body, and that conscious psychological facts must be studied in themselves, by means of “internal perception.” Like the discussion of Weber and Fechner, this negative assessment is extremely interesting in the light of Durkheim's visit to Wundt's laboratory in Leipzig just two years later, and his subsequent praise for Wundt's willingness “to reduce the higher forms of intelligence to experience,” and subject “the life of reason'' to “psychological scrutiny'' (1887a: 313-38, 423-40, 329 n. 16).

毫不奇怪，当迪尔凯姆转向心理现象研究中应用的不同方法，特别是 E · H · 韦伯(1795 ± 1878)和古斯塔夫 · 费希纳(18o1 ± 87)的心理-物理学派时，这一点变得尤为明显。在他的《精神物理学基本原理》(1860)中，Fechner 引入了一个数学公式，他称之为“强度定律”，也就是说，一种感觉的强度随着刺激的对数(即递减增量)增加而增加，从而被称为“ Weber ± Fechner 定律”，一些人认为这是定量实验心理学的开端(无聊1950:293; Ribot 1886:181 ± 8)。这条法律之所以重要，是因为迪尔凯姆在《社会劳动分工》(1893)一书中再次提到它，以支持他的论点，即人类对幸福的追求是有限的，因此必须将其作为劳动分工的一个可能原因而予以摒弃(1984:181 ± 2)。但是在第五次森斯的演讲中，迪尔凯姆断然否定了韦伯 ± 费希纳定律，理由是身体不仅仅是对灵魂物理刺激的被动传递者，而是根据个体和环境对其进行了重大修改(1884:37)。迪尔凯姆补充说，正是为了克服这个困难，威廉 · 冯特(1832 ± 192o)建立了心理-生理学派，将意识状态直接与生理现象联系起来，而不仅仅是物理现象。简而言之，对冯特而言，灵魂的有意识生命起源于肉体的无意识生命。但迪尔凯姆坚持认为，灵魂不能还原为身体，有意识的心理事实必须通过“内在感知”来研究自身就像韦伯和费希纳的讨论一样，这种消极的评价是非常有趣的，因为迪尔凯姆两年后参观了冯特在莱比锡的实验室，他随后赞扬了冯特愿意“减少高等形式的智力体验”，并将“理性的生活”置于“心理审查”之下(1887a: 313-38,423-40,329 n. 16)。

From these methodological observations, Durkheim turned to the “sensibility” and - most interesting for our purposes - to the inclinations. Depending on whether an object is agreeable or disagreeable to us, he observed, we tend towards it or distance ourselves from it. In the former case, we speak of an inclination; and there are as many different types of inclinations as there are types of objects producing these movements within us, including egoistic - i.e., those that have the self as their object - and altruistic - i.e., those that have other people as their object. Durkheim recognized that writers like Hobbes, Pascal, and Rousseau had questioned whether altruistic inclinations actually exist, insisting instead that the sole end of our inclinations is the maintenance or well-being of the self; but Durkheim insisted that “naturally” we are “made in such a way that we are concerned with ourselves and to have need of others'' (1884: 58). Unfortunately for our purposes, and “content for the moment'' with his appeal to human nature, Durkheim did not expand on the relationship between our egoistic and altruistic inclinations. Instead, probably following Fustel, he turned to an evolutionary treatment of the different groups or levels - e.g., the family, the city, the society, humanity itself - of altruistic inclinations. “Society is a union of families,'' Durkheim explained, and “humanity [is] a union of societies. It's from the love of the family that one is raised to the love of the society, and from that for society that one is raised to love of humanity'' (1884: 59). And when he returned to the relationship of egoistic and altruistic tendencies in the lecture on civic morality (see Lecture n. 64), his equally unenlightening reference was to the “voice of nature.''

从这些方法论的观察中，涂尔干转向了“感性”，并且——对于我们的目的来说最有趣的是——转向了倾向。他观察到，取决于一个对象对我们来说是愉快的还是不愉快的，我们倾向于它或者远离它。在前一种情况下，我们谈论一种倾向; 有许多不同类型的倾向，因为有许多类型的物体在我们内部产生这些运动，包括利己主义——也就是那些以自我为对象的物体——和利他主义——也就是那些以他人为对象的物体。迪尔凯姆认识到，像霍布斯、帕斯卡和卢梭这样的作家曾经质疑利他主义倾向是否真的存在，相反，他坚持认为我们的倾向的唯一目的是维持或自我的幸福; 但是迪尔凯姆坚持认为，“自然地”，我们是“以这样一种方式，我们关心自己，并需要他人”(1884:58)。不幸的是，为了我们的目的，以及“满足于当下”与他对人性的诉求，涂尔干没有扩展我们的利己主义和利他主义倾向之间的关系。相反，可能是跟随福斯特尔，他转向了利他主义倾向的不同群体或层次的进化论处理——例如，家庭、城市、社会、人类本身。涂尔干解释说: “社会是家庭的结合，而人类是社会的结合。”。一个人从家庭的爱中成长为社会的爱，从社会的爱中成长为人类的爱”(1884:59)。当他在关于公民道德的讲座中回到利己主义和利他主义倾向之间的关系时(见第64讲) ，他同样没有启发性的提到了“自然的声音”

Still, this passage in Lalande's notes is intriguing, for here Durkheim insisted - as he would later in L'Education morale - that the distinction between egoism and altruism should be sought, not in the distinction between tendencies whose goal is pleasure to the agent (egoism) and those whose goal is the pleasure of some other person (altruism), but in the distinction between the kinds of objects to which the agent is attached. For as he would later argue, the notion that egoism and altruism could be distinguished by an appeal to different kinds of pleasures made it inconceivable that they had the same origin, and led to the typical Enlightenment view that egoism was a part of “human nature,” while altruism was the laborious, “artificial” construction of culture and civilization. By focusing instead on the kinds of objects to which agents become attached, Durkheim had left open the door to the possibility that the distinction between egoistic and altruistic sentiments was not one between “nature” and “art.” But in 1883 Durkheim seems to have had no sense of how our attachment for things outside us presupposes the existence of their representations within us and, still more important, how such representations might be created and maintained by a society's institutions. As we shall see, the full realization of this point required a far closer reading of Rousseau than Durkheim had done by 1883.

尽管如此，拉兰德笔记中的这段话还是很耐人寻味，因为迪尔凯姆在这里坚持认为——正如他后来在《教育士气》中所说的那样——利己主义和利他主义之间的区别应该被寻求，而不是区分那些目的是为了取悦主体的倾向(利己主义)和那些目的是为了取悦他人的倾向(利他主义) ，而是区分主体所依附的对象的种类。正如他后来所说，利己主义和利他主义可以通过吸引不同种类的快乐来区分的概念，使得它们具有相同的起源是不可思议的，并且导致了典型的启蒙运动观点，即利己主义是“人性”的一部分，而利他主义是文化和文明的艰苦的、“人为的”建设。迪尔凯姆把注意力转移到那些使人产生依恋的物体上，这就为利己主义和利他主义情感之间的区别不是“自然”和“艺术”之间的区别打开了一扇大门但在1883年，迪尔凯姆似乎没有意识到，我们对外界事物的依恋是如何预先假定了它们在我们内心的表象的存在，更重要的是，这种表象是如何被一个社会的机构创造和维持的。正如我们将要看到的，要完全实现这一点，就需要比涂尔干在1883年时更仔细地阅读卢梭。

Turning from the sensibility to the intelligence, Durkheim asked and answered a series of questions that help us to understand the sense in which he was an epistemological realist. First, against John Stuart Mill (1806—73), Durkheim insisted that our idea of “the external world” is given rather than constructed? Second, against Sir William Hamilton (1788—1856) and Maine de Biran (1766—1824), Durkheim embraced the Kantian view that this idea of externality is given, not through experience, but a priori — i.e., by the very nature of the human mind (1884: 87—9). And third, he embraced the notion that the external world is “objective” — i.e., not the product of subjective mental events (1884: 91—4). These answers brought Durkheim to the crucial question for an epistemological realist: Is the external world as we perceive it? Do our sensations correspond to qualities naturally inherent in things?

从感性到智慧，涂尔干提出并回答了一系列问题，这些问题有助于我们理解他作为认识论现实主义者的意义。首先，反对约翰·斯图尔特·密尔(1806-73) ，迪尔凯姆坚持我们的“外部世界”的想法是给予的，而不是建构的？其次，与威廉·咸美顿(外交官)(1788-1856)和缅因-德-比兰(1766-1824)相反，迪尔凯姆接受康德的观点，即外在性的概念不是通过经验得到的，而是通过先验得到的ーー也就是说，通过人类思维的本质(1884:87-9)。第三，他接受了外部世界是“客观的”的观念ーー也就是说，不是主观心理事件的产物(1884:91ー4)。这些答案把涂尔干带到了一个认识论现实主义者的关键问题上: 外部世界是我们所感知的吗？我们的感觉是否与事物本身固有的品质相对应？

Durkheim's answer to these questions depended heavily on the classic distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of matter. Secondary qualities include things like heat, color, taste, odor, etc., for we can conceive of bodies without these things, and in fact not all bodies have them. The only two primary qualities are extension and movement, for we can’t conceive of a body that is not

涂尔干对这些问题的回答在很大程度上取决于物质的主要性质和次要性质之间的经典区别。次要品质包括热、颜色、味道、气味等，因为我们可以想象没有这些东西的身体，事实上并不是所有的身体都有这些东西。唯一的两个基本品质是延伸和运动，因为我们不能想象一个身体不是

- 9 Durkheim 1884: 84—7. See Mill’s Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865) and “Berkeley’s Life and Writings’’ (1871). both extended and mobile, and in fact all bodies have these two qualities. So Locke's distinction at least enables us to say what the external world is not ± i.e., since secondary qualities, as Durkheim put it rather awkwardly, “are only the appearances of forms of primary qualities, uniquely different through the intervention of our senses,'' there is no more to matter than the primary qualities of extension and movement (1884: 101±2). Matter, in short, is an extension susceptible of motion. Extension is also continuous, and thus must be divisible into parts. But here we confront a contradiction ± i.e., these parts cannot be finite in number, for each of the parts is itself divisible ad infinitum; and the number of parts cannot be infinite, for the notion of an infinite number is itself contradictory.[46](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark57) So the idea of extension itself, Durkheim argued, is a deceptive appearance, a deformation suffered by things when we perceive them through the intermediary of our senses; and since motion is simply a change in extension, the same applies to other primary qualities as well.

    9涂尔干1884:84ー7。参见密尔对威廉·咸美顿(外交官)哲学的考察(1865)和“伯克利的生活和写作”(1871)。事实上，所有的物体都具有这两个特性。所以洛克的区分至少使我们能够说外部世界不是 ± ，也就是说，因为第二性质，正如迪尔凯姆相当尴尬地说，“只是主要性质的表现形式，通过我们感官的干预而独特地不同,”没有比扩展和运动的主要性质更重要的事情了(1884:101 ± 2)。简而言之，物质是运动的延伸。扩展也是连续的，因此必须可以分成若干部分。但是在这里我们面临一个矛盾，也就是说，这些部分在数量上不可能是有限的，因为每个部分本身是无限可分的; 而部分的数量也不可能是无限的，因为无限数的概念本身就是矛盾的。因此，迪尔凯姆认为，延伸的概念本身是一种欺骗性的外观，是我们通过感官中介感知事物时所遭受的一种变形; 既然运动只是延伸的一种变化，那么同样的道理也适用于其他的基本属性。

Durkheim's solution is extremely important. If the body is not extended, it is still divisible into a finite number of unextended parts ± a conclusion that conforms to the atomistic hypothesis of physics and chemistry. These unextended elements of bodies are beings, Durkheim observed, and thus we can understand them only by analogy with the sole being of which we have knowledge ± i.e., our selves or souls. What kind of beings are we? Briefly, we are conscious, sensible, intelligent forces that move themselves. We have no reason to attribute consciousness, sensibility, or intelligence to the unextended elements of bodies; but we can imagine them as “similar to what our souls would be'' if they lacked consciousness, sensibility, and intelligence ± i.e., active, unconscious forces that limit and suppress the self. Just as our will acts upon our intelligence, entirely outside of extension, so these active, unconscious forces operate in the external world, placing limits and constraints on human beings.

涂尔干的解决方案非常重要。如果身体没有被延伸，它仍然可以被划分为有限数量的未延伸的部分 ± 一个符合物理和化学原子论假设的结论。迪尔凯姆观察到，身体的这些未扩展的元素是存在的，因此我们只能通过与我们所知的唯一存在的类比来理解它们，也就是我们的自我或灵魂。我们是什么生物？简而言之，我们是有意识的、明智的、能够自我移动的智能力量。我们没有理由将意识、情感或智力归因于身体的未扩展元素; 但是我们可以想象，如果它们缺乏意识、情感和智力，那么它们就“类似于我们的灵魂”，也就是说，限制和压制自我的积极的、无意识的力量。正如我们的意志作用于我们的智慧，完全在外延之外，这些活跃的、无意识的力量在外部世界中运作，对人类施加限制和约束。

This argument is important, not just because it reveals Durkheim as a realist at this early stage of his career, but because it tells us explicitly what kind of realist he was. If we conceive of the external world in the mechanistic manner of Descartes ± i.e., as comprised of extended bodies in motion ± we face the dif®culties implied by the incoherence of the idea of extension. But if we imagine the external world as comprised of beings similar to ourselves, but whose consciousness is almost entirely extinguished, in the manner of Aristotle and, above all, Leibniz, then there is no interruption in the continuity of nature: “From the perfect mind down to inorganic matter, everything is mind, everything is force.” Dead and inert properties do not exist, for everything in nature is animated and alive.11 “It is only a question,” Durkheim concluded, “of the degree of consciousness” (1884: 101).

这个论点很重要，不仅因为它揭示了涂尔干在职业生涯早期是一个现实主义者，而且因为它明确地告诉我们他是一个什么样的现实主义者。如果我们用笛卡尔的机械方式来设想外部世界，也就是说，由运动中的延伸物体组成，我们就会面对延伸观念的不连贯所暗示的困难。但是，如果我们把外部世界想象成与我们相似的存在，但是他们的意识几乎完全消失了，就像亚里士多德，尤其是莱布尼茨那样，那么自然的连续性就没有中断: “从完美的心灵到无机物，一切都是心灵，一切都是力量。”死的和惰性的属性并不存在，因为自然界中的一切都是活的和有生命的。“这只是一个问题,”涂尔干总结道，“关于意识的程度”(1884:101)。

If the senses thus provide us with knowledge of the external world, consciousness is the faculty whereby we acquire knowledge of the internal world. What, then, is the epistemological status of “internal perception” — i.e., the psychological method Durkheim had recommended in response to the German psycho-physical and psychophysiological schools? First, just as external perception requires the existence of an external object, so internal perception requires some sort of “internal, psychic modification.” Second, just as the “intervention of the self” is essential to external perception, so it is equally important to knowledge of the inner world. With the exception of a sense which serves as the inter mediary between a subject and an external object, therefore, the conditions of internal perception are identical with those of external perception. As we have just seen, however, Durkheim was a Leibnizian realist who believed that the external world is comprised of bodies themselves comprised of other, smaller bodies, ad infinitum. When we perceive bodies, however, we do not consciously perceive the microscopic bodies of which they are composed, which had led Leibniz to distinguish between conscious perceptions (apperceptions) and unconscious perceptions (“little perceptions”).[47](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark58) [48](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark59) Durkheim was fully aware of this Leibnizian notion of unconscious psychic phenomena, as well as the extended use of it by writers like Schopenhauer and Hartmann; and by the late 1890s, as we have seen, Durkheim himself would suggest that there live within us “other men than those with whom we are familiar,” suggesting the existence of “an unconscious psychic life beyond that of consciousness” (1884: 330). But in 1883, this was an idea with which Durkheim was uncomfortable. All the examples of unconscious psychic phenomena, he insisted, can be explained just as well by an extremely weak consciousness of such phenomena; and the idea of unconscious psychic phenomena is itself incoherent ± i.e., What would a psychic phenomenon that “left” consciousness become? Having left consciousness, how would it return? In the psychological life, Durkheim concluded, there is nothing that is absolutely unconscious.

如果感官因此为我们提供了外部世界的知识，那么意识就是我们获得内部世界知识的能力。那么，什么是“内在知觉”的认识论地位ーー即涂尔干推荐的心理学方法，以回应德国的心理生理学和心理生理学流派？首先，正如外部感知需要外部对象的存在一样，内部感知也需要某种“内在的、精神上的修正”第二，正如“自我介入”对于外在感知是必不可少的，对于内在世界的认识也同样重要。因此，除了作为主体和外在客体之间中介的感觉之外，内在感知的条件与外在感知的条件是相同的。然而，正如我们刚才所看到的，涂尔干是莱布尼兹的现实主义者，他认为外部世界是由其他较小的物体组成的，而且是无限的。然而，当我们感知身体时，我们不会有意识地感知由它们组成的微观身体，这导致莱布尼茨区分了有意识的感知(感知)和无意识的感知(“小感知”)。4748迪尔凯姆完全意识到莱布尼兹关于无意识精神现象的概念，以及叔本华和哈特曼等作家对这一概念的广泛运用; 正如我们所见，到了19世纪90年代末，迪尔凯姆自己会提出，在我们内心存在着“我们所熟悉的人以外的其他人”，暗示存在着“意识之外的无意识精神生活”(1884:330)。但在1883年，这个想法让涂尔干感到不舒服。他坚持认为，所有关于无意识心理现象的例子，都可以用对这种现象极其微弱的意识来解释; 而无意识心理现象的概念本身就是不连贯的，即，“离开”意识的心理现象会变成什么？在离开了意识之后，它会怎么回来呢？涂尔干总结说，在心理生活中，没有什么是绝对无意识的。

As we have seen, Durkheim’s treatment of sensory perceptions of the external world had asked whether the idea of exteriority was given by consciousness itself, or was rather constructed or invented by the mind. His discussion of internal perception now asked the same question about the idea of the self — and arrived at a similarly realist conclusion. Here Durkheim’s argument was addressed directly to Taine who, in De [’intelligence (2 vols., 1870), had first distinguished between “exterior sensations” (or perceptions) and “internal emotions,’’ and then described the self as the “imaginary container’’ of the latter. But the self, Durkheim objected, appears to us, not as a container, but as a center — i.e., a point of convergence where all states of consciousness are centralized. Moreover, Taine’s distinction presumes states of consciousness (i.e., exterior sensations) given outside the self, while in fact, every state of consciousness requires both a subject (one conscious of itself prior to sensation) and an object. The self is thus the indispensable, antecedent condition of every state of consciousness, and is thus given rather than being constructed. The difference between external and internal perception is that there is an abyss which separates the external world from us. The idea of the self, by contrast, is perceived directly in consciousness, and unlike the the external world, its non-existence is inconceivable. The existence of the self is demonstrated simply by the fact that we have the idea in the first place.

正如我们所看到的，迪尔凯姆对外部世界的感官知觉的处理提出了这样一个问题: 外在性的概念是由意识本身赋予的，还是由心灵构建或发明的。他关于内在感知的讨论现在又提出了关于自我概念的同样问题，并得出了一个类似的现实主义结论。在这里，涂尔干的论点直接针对泰恩，他在《德智力》(1870年第2卷)中首先区分了“外部感觉”(或感知)和“内部情绪”，然后将自我描述为后者的“想象容器”。但涂尔干反对说，在我们看来，自我不是一个容器，而是一个中心ーー也就是说，一个所有意识状态都集中的汇合点。此外，Taine 的区分假设意识状态(即外部感觉)给予外部的自我，而事实上，每个意识状态都需要一个主体(一个先于感觉的自我意识)和一个客体。因此，自我是每一种意识状态不可或缺的先决条件，并因此被给予而不是被建构。外在感知和内在感知的区别在于，有一个深渊将外部世界与我们分隔开来。相比之下，自我的概念是直接在意识中感知的，与外部世界不同，它的不存在是不可想象的。自我的存在仅仅通过我们首先有这个想法这个事实来证明。

This argument — clearly derived from Condillac’s Traite des sensations (1754) — was extremely important, for it laid the foundation for Durkheim’s account of the nature of the self. Consciousness and reasoning, Durkheim explained, suggest that the self possesses three natural attributes: unity (it is indivisible and has no parts), identity (by contrast to the endless flux of the external world, the self remains identical to itself), and causality (we know that we are among causes of our actions). And this in turn led to Durkheim’s notion of “personality,” with all of its significant consequences for his early, teleological ethics (see below). A being possessing unity, identity, and causality, he observed, is what we call a “person”; and while all persons are to the same degree “one” and “identical,” they are not all to the same degree “the causes of their own actions.'' In other words, each self is not a “person” to the same degree.

这个论点ーー显然来自于康迪拉克的《感觉的特性》(Traite des Sensations，1754)ーー极其重要，因为它奠定了迪尔凯姆关于自我本质的论述的基础。迪尔凯姆解释说，意识和推理表明，自我拥有三个自然属性: 统一性(它是不可分割的，没有部分) ，同一性(与外部世界无穷无尽的变化形成对比，自我与自身保持相同)和因果关系(我们知道我们是我们行为的原因之一)。这反过来又导致了迪尔凯姆的“个性”概念，以及它对他早期目的论伦理学的所有重要影响(见下文)。他观察到，一个拥有统一性、同一性和因果关系的存在，就是我们所说的“人”; 虽然所有的人都在同样的程度上是“一个”和“相同的”，但他们并不都在同样的程度上是“他们自己行为的原因”换句话说，每个自我在同等程度上不是一个“人”。

Thus described, perception and consciousness are the “experimental faculties,'' and the distinctive nature of the judgments they provide is that they are contingent — i.e., the mind can conceive of the contradictory judgment. The judgment: “Man is a sensible being,'' for example, is contingent, for we can conceive of a man who lacks sensibility. But consider another judgment: “Every phenomenon has a cause.'' In this case, the contradictory judgment is inconceivable; thus, we say that the proposition is necessary rather than contingent. Since judgments of this kind have a character just the opposite of the judgments provided by experience, there must be a faculty - the reason ± responsible for providing them; and necessary judgments are possible only in so far as they are a priori — i.e., they inhere in the very nature of the mind. What derives from the nature of a being, Durkheim added, is what we call the laws of this being; thus, reason is “the totality of the laws of the mind.''[49](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark60) And since the mind has its nature and laws, and the external world also has its nature and laws, things are known to the mind in so far as they are “in harmony'' with the laws of the mind.

如此描述，知觉和意识是“实验能力”，它们提供的判断的独特性质是它们是偶然的ーー也就是说，头脑可以设想矛盾的判断。例如，判断: “人是一个理性的存在”是偶然的，因为我们可以想象一个缺乏感性的人。但是考虑另一种判断: “每种现象都有一个原因。”在这种情况下，矛盾的判断是不可想象的，因此，我们说的命题是必要的，而不是偶然的。由于这种判断的性质与经验所提供的判断正好相反，因此必须有一种能力——提供判断的理由和责任; 只有在先验的情况下，必要的判断才有可能——也就是说，它们存在于心灵的本质之中。迪尔凯姆补充说，从一个存在的本质中衍生出来的，就是我们所说的存在的法则; 因此，理性是“心灵法则的总和。”。“49因为心有它的本性和律法，外在的世界也有它的本性和律法，所以只要事物与心的律法“和谐”，它们就是心所知道的。

Durkheim's account of the principles of reason recalls his later distinction, in his writing on education, between the clarity and simplicity of ideas and the complexity of real, concrete things. In essence, he observed, the mind is simple, and understands only that which is simple. When the mind examines things that are concrete and complex, therefore, it introduces the unity, order, and simplicity that its nature requires. First, the multiplicity of things given in experience are ordered by being placed in certain contexts — i.e., external perceptions given by the senses are placed in space, and internal perceptions given by consciousness are located in time. Thus we arrive at the first two rational principles: All states of consciousness are in time; and all phenomena given by sensation are in space. This initial order, however, is entirely “external,” so the mind is necessarily led to conceive of phenomena as the modi®cations of a being ± i.e., a reality independent of the intelligence itself ± which is called substance. Hence another rational principle: All phenomena are modifications of a substance. The mind cannot conceive of one phenomenon without assuming another. This gives us still another principle: Every phenomenon has a cause. Finally, the mind is led to represent these series of phenomena as converging toward their common goal or end, resulting in the principle: Every phenomenon or series of phenomena has an end. These are what Kant called the ®ve “constitutive principles of experience” ± i.e., time, space, substance, causality, and finality. Once constituted, however, our knowledge itself has certain laws, which Kant called the regulative principle of knowledge, or the principle of identity and contradiction ± i.e., All that is, is; a thing cannot, at the same time and at the same perspective, be itself and its contrary. Whatever exists, Durkheim thus concluded, there are two different kinds of rational principles ± those governing the acquisition of knowledge, and those governing the kinds of knowledge acquired.

迪尔凯姆对理性原则的描述，让人想起他后来在关于教育的著作中，对思想的清晰和简单，以及真实和具体事物的复杂性所作的区分。他观察到，从本质上说，心是简单的，只理解那些简单的东西。因此，当头脑审视具体而复杂的事物时，它就引入了它的本性所要求的统一性、秩序性和简单性。首先，经验中所给予的事物的多样性是通过放置在特定的环境中来排序的ーー也就是说，感官所给予的外在感知被放置在空间中，而意识所给予的内在感知被放置在时间中。因此，我们得出了前两个理性的原则: 所有的意识状态都是在时间中的; 所有由感觉给予的现象都是在空间中的。然而，这个最初的秩序完全是“外在的”，因此心灵必然会把现象想象为一个存在的调节，也就是说，一个独立于智力本身的现实，即所谓的物质。因此，另一个理性原则是: 所有的现象都是物质的变形。头脑不能设想一种现象而不设想另一种。这给了我们另一个原则: 每一种现象都有一个原因。最后，心灵被引导去把这一系列的现象表现为朝着它们共同的目标或终点汇聚，从而产生一个原则: 每一种现象或一系列现象都有终点。这些就是康德所说的“经验的构成原则”，即，时间，空间，物质，因果关系和结局。然而，一旦构成，我们的知识本身就有一定的规律，康德称之为知识的规律性原则，或者同一性和矛盾性原则，即，一切都是，就是; 一个事物不可能在同一时间和同一角度，既是它自己，又是它的对立面。无论存在什么，涂尔干因此得出结论，有两种不同的理性原则 ± 那些支配获得知识，和那些支配种类的知识获得。

It was these “principles,” of course, for which Durkheim sought to provide sociological explanations in “De quelques formes primitives de classi®cation” (1903) and Les Formes elementaires (1912). So it’s worth noting that, in 1883, Durkheim was already aware of efforts ± the “most remarkable” being that of Herbert Spencer (1820±1903) ± to deny the a priori origin of these ideas and explain them empirically. Before experience, Durkheim paraphrased Spencer, we do not possess the idea of time; instead, we have only states of consciousness with certain relations of position between them ± i.e., some in front, some behind. We generalize from these relative positions of the states of consciousness, constructing the idea of time; and from this idea, those of temporal co-existence and then space are also constructed. But if the idea of time did not already exist, Durkheim objected, we could not conceive of states of consciousness before and after one another. Similarly, geometric ®gures are not abstracted from generalized observations, but are rather constructed a priori, by the mind itself. For in a generalization there is nothing more than the things generalized, which are concrete and imperfect; and geometric ®gures have the additional characteristic of perfection ± something that cannot be learned from experience. This is why the mathematical sciences are so clear, and we understand these objects so well ± i.e., we are the ones who have made them.

当然，正是这些“原则”，迪尔凯姆在1903年的《分类的原始形式》和1912年的《基本形式》中试图提供社会学上的解释。因此值得注意的是，在1883年，涂尔干已经意识到“最显著”的努力是赫伯特 · 斯宾塞(1820 ± 1903) ± 否认这些思想的先验起源，并以经验解释它们。在经验之前，涂尔干解释斯宾塞，我们不拥有时间的概念; 相反，我们只有意识的状态与它们之间的某些位置关系 ± 即，一些在前面，一些在后面。我们从这些意识状态的相对位置概括出来，构建了时间的概念，并由此构建了时间共存和空间的概念。但是，迪尔凯姆反对说，如果时间的概念不存在，我们就不能设想意识状态在彼此之前和之后的情况。同样地，几何图形不是从广义的观察中抽象出来的，而是由心灵本身先验地构造出来的。因为在一般化中，没有什么比一般化的事物更具体和不完美的了; 几何图形具有完美的附加特征 ± 某些不能从经验中学到的东西。这就是为什么数学科学如此清晰，我们如此了解这些物体，也就是说，我们是制造它们的人。

An alternative empiricist account of reason — “best studied” in Mill’s System of Logic (1843) and Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy (1865) — argued that the “necessity” of rational judgments can be explained as the consequence of habit and the association of ideas. Briefly, when two states of consciousness occur together in the same order a certain number of times, the mind tends to reproduce them in this order, with as much force as the frequency with which the experience has been repeated. When the frequency is without exceptions, the association of ideas becomes so strong that it is indissoluble, and the judgment formed is called “necessary.” All phenomena are thus presented to us as forming inseparable pairs, including an antecedent (cause) and a consequent (effect). To say that all phenomena have an invariable antecedent is to say that every phenomenon has a cause. To these arguments of Mill, Durkheim made three objections. First, Mill had shown that arguments now considered to be “necessary” were at other times regarded as absurd; but “absurd,” Durkheim observed, is not the same as inconceivable, and the characteristic feature of rational judgments is precisely that their contradiction cannot be conceived. Second, while the tendency to associate ideas that are frequently produced together is incontestable, Durkheim denied that this tendency ever approaches the impossibility of separating the terms uniting them. In fact, there are ideas we always unite, but which we can, if we wish, imagine apart.[50](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark61) Experience, in short, never undermines the freedom of our thought. And third, in order for us to accept the necessity of a relation of succession that we have observed several times, we must already know that they are disposed in inseparable pairs — i.e., we must already have the idea of causality. “With subjective sensations,” Durkheim concluded, “we cannot construct anything objective. With phenomena, we cannot construct the idea of substance. With the contingent, we cannot construct the necessary. One can accumulate lots of contingent truths, but they don’t change in nature. One cannot find in experience that which is its very condition’’ (1884: 151).

另一种经验主义对理性的解释ーー在密尔的《逻辑系统》(1843年)和《威廉·咸美顿(外交官)哲学考察》(1865年)中的“最佳研究”ーー认为，理性判断的“必要性”可以解释为习惯和思想联系的结果。简而言之，当两种意识状态同时以同样的顺序出现若干次时，头脑倾向于以这种顺序重现它们，其力量与经验重复的频率一样大。当这种频率无一例外的时候，思想的联系就变得如此强烈，以至于不可分割，形成的判断就被称为“必要”因此，所有的现象都呈现给我们，形成不可分割的对，包括一个前因(原因)和一个后果(效果)。说所有的现象都有一个不变的前提，就是说每个现象都有一个原因。对于穆勒的这些论点，涂尔干提出了三个反对意见。首先，密尔已经证明，现在被认为是“必要的”的论点在其他时候被认为是荒谬的; 但是迪尔凯姆观察到，“荒谬”并不等同于不可思议，理性判断的特征正是它们的矛盾不能被构想出来。其次，虽然将经常产生的想法联系在一起的倾向是无可争议的，涂尔干否认这种倾向曾经接近于不可能将它们联系在一起的术语分离开来。事实上，有些想法我们总是团结在一起，但如果我们愿意，我们可以想象分开。50简而言之，经验从来不会破坏我们思想的自由。第三，为了让我们接受我们多次观察到的继承关系的必要性，我们必须已经知道它们是不可分割的一对ーー也就是说，我们必须已经有了因果关系的概念。涂尔干总结道: “凭借主观感觉，我们无法构建任何客观的东西。有了现象，我们就不能建构物质的概念。有了分遣队，我们就无法构建必要的。一个人可以积累许多偶然的真理，但它们在本质上是不会改变的。一个人不能在经验中找到它本身的条件”(1884:151)。

But if individual experience thus fails to account for our possession of rational judgments, what about the experience of the species? In his First Principles (1850), Herbert Spencer had accepted the view that rational ideas are innate in each individual, while insisting that they are a “trust” formed by the accumulated experience of the species, and transmitted through heredity. Durkheim’s initial objection here was one he had also entered in opposition to associationism — i.e., “evolutionism” has a marked tendency to consider differences as only apparent, and to attempt to reduce them to a single type. But nothing, Durkheim insisted, proves that objects present this absolute unity; on the contrary, everything conspires to suggest that multiplicity and diversity are the law of things. The best method to follow, therefore, is to look for differences and to respect them. Second, since it is obviously impossible to ®nd even a primitive tribe whose members lack rational principles, evolutionism is a hypothesis that is impossible to verify experimentally. Third, empiricism necessarily regards the mind, before experience, as a tabula rasa — i.e., without a determinate nature of its own. But the indeterminate does not really exist, Durkheim insisted, so the empiricists are reduced to arguing that the mind exists only at the moment when experience begins. Yet even empiricists like Spencer admit that, to form rational judgments, the multiplicity given in experience must be integrated in the mind. If the mind does not possess an integrative faculty, such judgments are impossible. So again, Durkheim concluded, empiricism leads us into a vicious circle.

但是，如果个人经验因此无法解释我们拥有理性判断，那么物种的经验又如何呢？在他的第一原则(1850年)中，赫伯特 · 斯宾塞(Herbert Spencer)接受了理性思想是每个个体与生俱来的观点，同时坚持认为理性思想是一种“信任”，由物种的积累经验形成，并通过遗传传递。涂尔干最初的反对意见也是反对联想主义的，即“进化论”有一种明显的倾向，即认为差异只是表面上的，并试图将它们归为一种类型。但涂尔干坚持认为，没有任何东西能够证明物体呈现出这种绝对的统一性; 相反，所有事物都合谋暗示多样性和多样性是事物的法则。因此，最好的方法就是寻找差异并尊重它们。其次，由于显然不可能，甚至一个原始部落的成员缺乏理性的原则，进化论是一个假设，不可能得到实验验证。第三，经验主义必然把经验之前的心灵视为一张白板ーー也就是说，它本身没有确定的性质。但涂尔干坚持认为，不确定性并不真正存在，因此经验主义者只能简单地认为，心灵只存在于经验开始的那一刻。然而，即使是像斯宾塞这样的经验主义者也承认，要形成理性判断，经验中的多样性必须在头脑中得到整合。如果头脑不具备综合能力，这样的判断是不可能的。因此，涂尔干再次得出结论，经验主义将我们带入了一个恶性循环。

With regard to reason, therefore, Durkheim took a strongly Kantian position in opposition to empiricists like Mill and Spencer. There are two sources of knowledge: experience and reason; and since reason cannot be derived from experience, Durkheim insisted that rational ideas and principles are innate within us. But if rational principles are thus the laws of mind, Durkheim observed, it remains to show that they are also the laws of things. Do the laws of the mind have an objective value? For Kant, Durkheim observed, rational principles had only a subjective value. Though not denying the existence of the external world, Kant had insisted that the sensible multiplicity that experience provides is confused and disordered. In order to know things, we must transform and denature them, imposing an artihcial order that enables us to understand them.

关于理性，因此，涂尔干采取了强烈的康德立场反对经验主义如密尔和斯宾塞。知识有两个来源: 经验和理性; 由于理性不能从经验中派生出来，涂尔干坚持认为理性的思想和原则是与生俱来的。但迪尔凯姆观察到，如果理性原则就是心灵的法则，那么它仍然可以表明它们也是事物的法则。心灵的法则有客观的价值吗？迪尔凯姆注意到，对于康德来说，理性原则只有一个主观价值。尽管康德没有否认外部世界的存在，但他坚持认为，经验提供的感性多样性是混乱和无序的。为了了解事物，我们必须改变它们，使它们变性，强加一种人为的秩序，使我们能够理解它们。

Durkheim’s response to Kant was a classic example of eclecticism. For the empiricists, he reminded his students, knowledge is produced exclusively by the action of things on the mind. For Kant, by contrast, knowledge is produced exclusively by the action of the mind on things. Both of these theories, Durkheim then argued, are too extreme. Of the two, empiricism is the less logical, for it denies the mind its own, deter minate nature; but if Durkheim thus agreed with Kant that the for ms of the mind are de®nite and immutable, he also insisted that there are equally de®nite and concrete external objects. Knowledge must therefore be a synthesis of objective and subjective elements, which raises the question: What comes from things? And what comes from the mind? To answer these questions, we need an objective principle ± one which is not itself constitutive of experience ± and Durkheim found this in the principle of identity and contradiction. Applying this principle to our knowledge of the external world, Durkheim then repeated parts of the Leibnizian argument presented earlier, showing that our notions of continuity and in®nity embody contradictions, that they cannot be in things, and that they are thus merely subjective necessities of the mind.

涂尔干对康德的回应是折衷主义的一个典型例子。对于经验主义者来说，他提醒他的学生，知识完全是由思想上的事物的行为产生的。相比之下，康德认为，知识完全是由心灵对事物的行为产生的。涂尔干接着说，这两种理论都太极端了。在这两者中，经验主义的逻辑性较弱，因为它否定了心灵本身，威慑了自然; 但是如果涂尔干因此同意康德的观点，即心灵的因果关系是唯一的和不可改变的，他也坚持认为存在同样唯一的和具体的外部对象。因此，知识必须是客观要素和主观要素的综合，这就提出了一个问题: 什么来自事物？什么来自心灵？为了回答这些问题，我们需要一个客观原则，这个原则本身不是经验的组成部分，涂尔干在同一性和矛盾性原则中找到了这个原则。将这一原则应用到我们对外部世界的认识上，涂尔干接着重复了前面提出的莱布尼兹论证的部分内容，表明我们关于连续性和一体性的概念体现了矛盾，它们不能存在于事物中，因此它们仅仅是心灵的主观必需品。

What was Durkheim's early position on free will versus determinism? This question is important, in part because later critics would consider Durkheim's social realism incompatible with freedom of the will, and also because Durkheim had been a student of Boutroux, whose De la contingence des lois de la nature (1874) was an important contribution to the antideterminist position. Freedom, Durkheim paraphrased Kant, is the faculty each of us has to commence a series of actions — i.e., for our will to be the ®rst term in any series of events, without itself being determined by any prior term. That we possess such a faculty is proved directly by the idea that we have of our freedom ± i.e., we could not have acquired this idea from our experience of the external world, for it is governed by an absolute determinism; and the same conclusion is reached indirectly by the fact that, without freedom, we cannot explain certain facts ± e.g., contracts, promises, civil punishment, reward, etc. ± of daily life, and also by Kant's categorical imperative ± i.e., the moral law that would be impossible if human beings lacked freedom.[51](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark62)

涂尔干早期关于自由意志与决定论的立场是什么？这个问题很重要，部分是因为后来的批评家认为涂尔干的社会现实主义与意志自由不相容，也因为涂尔干是布特鲁克斯的学生，布特鲁克斯的《自然法的偶然性》(1874)是对反决定论立场的重要贡献。迪尔凯姆对康德的解释是，自由是我们每个人都必须开始一系列行动的能力，也就是说，我们的意志是任何一系列事件中的第一个条件，而不是由任何先前的条件决定的。我们拥有这样一种能力的直接证据是我们拥有自由的观点，也就是说，我们不可能从我们对外部世界的经验中获得这种观点，因为它受到绝对决定论的支配; 同样的结论也间接地由这样一个事实得出: 没有自由，我们就无法解释日常生活中的某些事实，例如，契约、承诺、民事惩罚、报酬等，还有康德的定言令式，也就是说，如果人类没有自由，就不可能有道德法则

Determinists object to this idea of freedom, of course, arguing that it is incompatible with the principle of causality. Psychological determinists like Leibniz and Mill, for example, argue that the idea of freedom contradicts the laws of the internal world of the mind ± i.e., our actions are guided by our motives, which derive from our intelligence, accidents of life, our character, habits, etc., which are determining causes; and even where we have a choice among several motives, the struggle between them is itself determined by causes of the same kind. Everything, in short, passes mechanically in our wills. Where we have several motives, Durkheim agreed, then once the decision as to which is the stronger motive is made, the action is “determined.” Freedom, in short, does not lie between this decision and the execution of the action. But freedom does reside, Durkheim insisted, between the conception of the end of the action and the choice of the strongest motive. Indeed, it is this capacity for reflection and deliberation that distinguishes us from the lower animals.

决定论者反对这种自由的观点，当然，他们认为这与因果原则不相容。例如，像莱布尼茨和密尔这样的心理决定论者认为，自由的概念违背了内心世界的规律，也就是说，我们的行为是由我们的动机引导的，这些动机来自于我们的智力、生活的意外、我们的性格、习惯等等，它们是决定性的原因; 即使我们可以在几种动机中做出选择，它们之间的斗争本身也是由同一种原因决定的。简而言之，一切都在我们的意志中机械地流逝。在我们有几个动机的地方，涂尔干同意，那么一旦决定哪个是更强的动机，行动是“决定的。”简而言之，自由并不存在于这个决定和行动的执行之间。但是涂尔干坚持认为，自由确实存在于行动结束的概念和选择最强有力的动机之间。事实上，正是这种反思和深思的能力将我们与低等动物区别开来。

Scientific determinists, by contrast, insist that freedom is incompatible with the laws of the external world of nature. When we think of nature under the form of causality, Durkheim reminded his students, it is revealed to us as an immense series of causes and effects; and if a person could act freely, it would interrupt and disturb this series, contradicting the principle of causality. The most vigorous effort to resolve this dif®culty presented by scienti®c determinism, Durkheim observed, was that of Kant. The self, Kant argued, can know itself only by thinking of itself under the form of rational principles, which are the condition of all knowledge. The self must therefore apply to itself the a priori forms of the sensibility, and the categories of the understanding; and in doing so, the self denatures and transforms itself. The real, primitive self was not subject to these principles; but the conscious, reflective self thinks of itself under the form of time, and under the concept of space. Two selves are thus formed: the noumenal self, which is, but is not known; and the phenomenal self, which is known, but which is not. Kant thus resolved the antinomy of freedom versus determinism by assigning science and ethics to two different worlds: the principle of causality rules in the phenomenal world; and freedom reigns in the noumenal world.

相比之下，科学决定论者坚持认为自由与外部世界的自然规律是不相容的。当我们以因果关系的形式思考自然时，迪尔凯姆提醒他的学生们，它向我们揭示了一系列巨大的因果关系; 如果一个人可以自由行动，它就会打断和扰乱这一系列，这与因果关系的原则相矛盾。迪尔凯姆注意到，为了解决科学决定论所带来的这种困难，康德付出了最大的努力。康德认为，自我只有在理性原则的形式下思考自身才能认识自身，理性原则是一切知识的条件。因此，自我必须将感性的先验形式和理解的范畴应用于自身; 在这样做的过程中，自我改变和转化了自身。真实的、原始的自我不受这些原则的约束，而是有意识的、反思的自我在时间的形式和空间的概念下思考自己。这样就形成了两个自我: 一个是本体自我，它是已知的，但不是已知的; 另一个是现象自我，它是已知的，但不是已知的。因此，康德解决了自由与决定论的矛盾，把科学和伦理分配到两个不同的世界: 现象世界的因果原则规则; 和自由统治的本体世界。

This description of the classic Kantian distinction between the noumenal and phenomenal worlds is extremely interesting, for it would do a great deal of work in Durkheim's later treatment of the duality of human nature; but at Sens in 1883, Durkheim rejected Kant's argument on the ground that the doctrine conserves, not real freedom, but only possible freedom.[52](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark63) The actions of our lives, being purely phenomenal, would be determined, while the will, imprisoned in the noumenal world, would be unable to exert its influence on phenomena. The freedom Kant offers us is thus only a virtual, sterile, metaphysical freedom. At this early stage in his thinking, therefore, Durkheim agreed with the determinists that so long as we think of things solely under the form of causality, there is no contingency, and thus no freedom. How, then, is freedom to be made consistent with the principle of causality? Briefly, Durkheim observed, if the relation between phenomena is determined, the direction in which the series of phenomena is tending is not. For the direction of the series is decided according to the principle of finality, and the necessity called for by this principle is far less rigorous than that of causality — i.e., the same end can be achieved through quite different means. The ends assigned to innumerable series of phenomena can be fulfilled in a variety of ways, and this is where freedom can be introduced into the external world.

这种对康德本体世界和现象世界之间的经典区分的描述非常有趣，因为它在涂尔干后来对人性二重性的处理中起到了很大的作用，但是在1883年的桑斯，涂尔干拒绝了康德的论点，理由是该学说保存的不是真正的自由，而只是可能的自由。因此，康德提供给我们的自由只是一种虚拟的、贫瘠的、形而上学的自由。因此，在他思想的早期阶段，涂尔干同意决定论者的观点，只要我们仅仅以因果关系的形式思考事物，就没有偶然性，因此也就没有自由。那么，如何使自由符合因果关系原则呢？简而言之，涂尔干观察到，如果现象之间的关系是确定的，那么一系列现象趋向的方向就不是。因为序列的方向是根据终结性原则决定的，而这一原则所要求的必要性远没有因果关系的必要性严格ーー也就是说，同样的目的可以通过完全不同的方式实现。分配给无数系列现象的目的可以通过各种方式来实现，这就是自由可以被引入外部世界的地方。

From these lectures on psychology — the science that describes states of consciousness, Durkheim turned to logic — the science that explains the laws that the mind should follow in the pursuit of truth. As we have seen, Durkheim defined “truth” as the conformity of the mind and things, adding that “certainty” is the state of mind that knows that it possesses the truth. By what criterion, then, do we know that we are in the possession of truth? The notion that this criterion is inherent in judgments clearly fails, Durkheim argued, for it can’t explain the diversity of opinions — i.e., if judgments really carried their own criterion of truth, the consequence would be universal acceptance rather than disagreement and controversy. Durkheim thus suggested that there may be diverse criteria of truth, leading to at least three different kinds of certainty: mathematical, i.e., resulting from mathematical demonstration; physical, i.e., the intuitive certainty provided by our observations; and ethical, i.e., resulting in a kind of moral certainty. The criterion of mathematical certainty, he then observed, is identity, while the criterion of physical certainty is the authority of concrete facts. What characterizes moral certainties, however, is that they are not unanimously taken for truths — i.e., they possess no objective sign — and they are thus deprived of the criterion permitting the mind to decide immediately whether they are true or false.

从这些心理学讲座ーー描述意识状态的科学，涂尔干转向逻辑ーー解释心灵在追求真理时应遵循的规律的科学。正如我们所看到的，涂尔干将“真理”定义为心灵与事物的一致性，并补充说，“确定性”是知道自己拥有真理的心灵状态。那么，根据什么标准，我们才能知道我们拥有真理呢？迪尔凯姆认为，这个标准是判断中固有的观念显然是失败的，因为它无法解释观点的多样性ーー也就是说，如果判断真的带有他们自己的真理标准，结果将是普遍接受，而不是分歧和争议。涂尔干因此提出，可能存在不同的真理标准，导致至少三种不同类型的确定性: 数学的，即，由数学证明; 物理的，即，由我们的观察提供的直观的确定性; 和伦理的，即，导致一种道德的确定性。他接着观察到，数学确定性的标准是同一性，而物理确定性的标准是具体事实的权威性。然而，道德确定性的特征在于，它们并非一致地被视为真理ーー也就是说，它们没有客观标志ーー因此，它们被剥夺了允许心灵立即决定它们是真是假的标准。

How, then, are we to account for the certainty of our moral judgments? Briefly, Durkheim explained, in the case of moral judgments, our understanding — influenced by our will which, in turn, is influenced by our sensibility (temperament, education, habits, heredity) — is led in a specific direction, seeing only the reasons on one side rather than the other, and thus affirms or denies with certainty. In short, the understanding is no longer produced by the action of the judgment on the mind; on the contrary, it is produced by the action of the mind on the judgment, making our moral judgments essentially personal; and precisely because our will and our sensibility are so personal, we hold to our ethical judgments with a special tenacity, for without them, we would not be who we are. As we shall see, this epistemological notion of moral judgments as personal and subjective fits well with Durkheim’s later Sens lectures on ethics; but of course it could hardly be more different from his arguments — just a few years later — in favor of an empirical “science of ethics.’’

那么，我们如何解释我们道德判断的确定性呢？简而言之，迪尔凯姆解释道，在道德判断的案例中，我们的理解ーー受我们的意志影响，而意志又受我们的感性(气质、教育、习惯、遗传)的影响ーー被引向一个特定的方向，只看到一方的理由，而不是另一方的理由，因此肯定或否定是肯定的。简而言之，理解不再由心灵的判断行为产生; 相反，它是由心灵的判断行为产生的，使我们的道德判断本质上是个人的; 正是因为我们的意志和感性是如此的个人化，我们以一种特殊的韧性坚持我们的道德判断，因为没有它们，我们就不会是我们自己。正如我们将要看到的，这种认识论上的道德判断是个人的和主观的概念，与涂尔干后期关于伦理学的森斯讲座非常吻合; 但是当然，它与他的论点(仅仅几年之后)几乎没有什么不同，他支持一种经验主义的“伦理学”

Since Durkheim’s social realist vocabulary included methodological injunctions — e.g., treat social facts comme des choses — as well as theoretical observations, it’s also important to pay attention to what the Sens lectures say about the scienti®c method. In general, Durkheim seems to have considered the emphasis on method in science as excessive, insisting that important scientific discoveries “are the result of what is not given by method — the strength of genius’’ (1884: 356—7). But if method is not sufficient to invention, Durkheim admitted, it is nonetheless necessary to testing, validating, and corroborating hypotheses in the various sciences, and he dealt with this concern in his lectures on “applied logic.’’

由于迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义词汇包括方法论上的训诫ーー例如，把社会事实当作事物来对待ーー以及理论上的观察，因此关注森斯的讲座对科学方法所说的内容也很重要。一般来说，迪尔凯姆似乎认为科学中对方法的强调过分了，他坚持认为重要的科学发现“是方法没有给出的结果ーー天才的力量”(1884:356ー7)。但是，涂尔干承认，如果方法不足以发明，尽管如此，还是有必要在各种科学中检验、验证和证实假设，他在关于“应用逻辑”的讲座中谈到了这个问题

Every scientific method, Durkheim observed, must include two parts: first, invention — i.e., of theorems, the distinctive contribution of genius, seated in the imagination; and second, demonstration with the aid of de®nitions, axioms, and deduction. In the physical sciences, the important role of invention lies in the formulation of hypotheses to explain the facts that have been observed. Here Durkheim emphasized the role of analogy — i.e., a kind of reasoning whereby we ®rst ascertain one fact, and then apply to it the law of another fact (one which resembles but is not identical to the ®rst), and thus produce a new discovery. In this case of a hypothesis drawn from an analogy, Durkheim repeated, there is room for considerable creativity — the distinctive contribution of the imagination — so that in the invention of every hypothesis there is a large degree of contingency. But whether drawn from analogy or not, Durkheim emphasized, a hypothesis is always a law that has not yet been verified; and it is verifiable, Durkheim cited Claude Bernard’s Introduction a l’etude de la medecine experimentale (1865), through experimentation and then induction (i.e., the extension of the law to every possible experience), not through the direct manipulation of phenomena.

涂尔干观察到，每一种科学方法都必须包括两个部分: 第一，发明ーー即，定理，天才的独特贡献，存在于想象之中; 第二，借助定义、公理和演绎进行论证。在自然科学中，发明的重要作用在于提出假设来解释已经观察到的事实。涂尔干在这里强调了类比的作用ーー即一种推理，我们首先确定一个事实，然后将另一个事实的规律(一个类似但不完全相同的事实)应用于它，从而产生一个新的发现。迪尔凯姆重复道，在这种从类比中得出的假设中，存在着相当大的创造性空间ーー想象力的独特贡献ーー因此，在每一个假设的创造中，都存在着很大程度的偶然性。但是，无论是否从类比中得出，涂尔干强调，一个假设总是一个尚未得到验证的规律; 它是可以验证的，涂尔干引用了克劳德 · 伯纳德的《实验医学导论》(1865) ，通过实验，然后归纳(即，将规律扩展到每一种可能的经验) ，而不是通过直接操纵现象。

An obvious objection to this criterion of the veri®cation of hypothetical laws was that it necessarily excluded both meteorology and natural history from the status of sciences. But this was a consequence that Durkheim was willing to accept. “Every science which lacks experimentation also lacks law,” he explained, “for the existence of a law implies a hypothesis, experimentation, induction” (1884: 370). Meteorology and natural history are thus “histories” that ascertain and classify certain facts, but are not themselves “true sciences.” The classihcation of facts aids the memory, Durkheim added, but its primary purpose is to rediscover the order of things according to the ends assigned to them. Classihcation, Durkheim thus explained, is guided by the principle offinality.

一个明显的反对这个标准的核实假设的法律是，它必然排除了气象学和自然历史从科学的地位。但这是涂尔干愿意接受的结果。“每一门缺乏实验的科学也缺乏规律,”他解释道，“因为规律的存在意味着一种假设、实验和归纳”(1884:370)。因此，气象学和自然历史是确定和分类某些事实的“历史”，但它们本身并不是“真正的科学”涂尔干补充说，事实的分类有助于记忆，但其主要目的是根据分配给事物的目的重新发现事物的秩序。涂尔干这样解释道，分类是以罪性原则为指导的。

This brought Durkheim to his lecture on method in “moral” sciences — i.e., those “concerned with the human mind,” including the philosophical, social, philological, and historical sciences. Having already dealt with method in philosophy, Durkheim turned hrst to politics, law, and political economy — where his observations could hardly contrast more sharply with Les Regles. The science of society, for example, is politics (not sociology), and its purpose is not to study social facts but to ascertain the best form that human societies might take.[53](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark64) In the Republic, Plato had approached this problem geometrically, but more recently, Durkheim observed, history has provided the means to make politics an observational and experimental science. Law, by contrast, begins from the foundation of human legal systems, from which it deduces applications to the particular cases of human life, while political economy — once treated deductively in the manner of law — is now approached primarily through observation and experience. The philological sciences are similarly inductive, practicing that method that looks for analogies beneath differences, leading to comparative philology; and hnally, the historical sciences rely on the criticism of testimonial evidence. In sum, for anyone possessing what C. W. Mills once called “the sociological imagination,” the discussion of the moral sciences in the Sens lectures is a crashing bore.

这使得迪尔凯姆开始了他关于“道德”科学方法的演讲ーー也就是那些“与人类心智有关”的科学，包括哲学、社会学、语言学和历史学。迪尔凯姆已经研究过哲学中的方法论，于是他转而研究政治、法律和政治经济学ーー在这些领域，他的观察结果与 Les Regles 形成了鲜明的对比。例如，社会科学是政治学(而不是社会学) ，它的目的不是研究社会事实，而是确定人类社会可能采取的最佳形式。在《理想国》中，柏拉图以几何学的方式处理这个问题，但是最近，涂尔干观察到，历史提供了使政治成为一门观察和实验科学的手段。相比之下，法律从人类法律体系的基础开始，从中推断出对人类生活的特殊情况的适用，而政治经济学(曾经以法律的方式进行推理)现在主要通过观察和经验来处理。语言学科学同样是归纳的，实践的方法是在差异之下寻找类比，从而导致比较语言学，而历史科学则依赖于对证据的批判。总而言之，对于任何一个拥有 C.W. 米尔斯曾经称之为“社会学的想象力”的人来说，森斯讲座中关于道德科学的讨论无聊透顶。

THE SCIEnCE OF ENDS

结局的科学

Durkheim’s social realism was in some ways a sociological redescription of Kant. The treatment of ethics in the Sens lectures is almost equally Kantian, but in an entirely different — and entirely unsocio-logical — way. To accept our moral responsibilities, Durkheim began, is to accept the fact that we are subject to a moral law. But in addition to this acceptance, there are two “psychic conditions” necessary for moral responsibility. The first is freedom — i.e., to be held responsible, each of us must be the sole cause of his actions — and the second is the identity of the self — i.e., to be held responsible for things we have done in the past, the two selves (past and present) must be one and the same. The “moral law’’ itself must first be absolute — i.e., it must command unconditionally. Second, it must be universal — i.e., the same in all societies and historical periods. Third, it must be obligatory — i.e., the moral law commands, and we are bound to obey.

涂尔干的社会现实主义在某种程度上是对康德的社会学重新描述。在森斯的讲座中，对伦理学的处理几乎同样是康德式的，只是方式完全不同，而且完全不符合社会逻辑。迪尔凯姆开始接受我们的道德责任，就是接受我们受制于道德法则的事实。但是，除了这种接受之外，还有两个“精神条件”是道德责任所必需的。第一个是自由ーー也就是说，要对自己的行为负责，我们每个人都必须是他行为的唯一原因ーー第二个是自我的身份ーー也就是说，要对我们过去所做的事情负责，两个自我(过去的和现在的)必须是一个和相同的。“道德法则”本身必须首先是绝对的ーー也就是说，它必须无条件地发号施令。其次，它必须具有普遍性ーー也就是说，在所有社会和历史时期都是一样的。第三，它必须是强制性的ーー也就是说，道德律令，我们必须服从。

The problem with earlier efforts to define the moral law, Durkheim complained, is that they typically fail to meet one or more of these conditions. The utilitarians,[54](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark65) for example, rest the moral law on interest; but, in a manner not unlike his later critique of utilitarianism, Durkheim insisted that interest is essentially personal, variable, and subjective — i.e., a more or less immediate pleasure that varies from one person, country, or historical period to another. By what right, for example, does Epicurus affirm that his pleasures are those of everyone? The utilitarian definition of the moral law thus fails to meet the conditions of universality; and since nothing is more dif®cult to recognize than our own, individual self-interest, a moral law based upon self-interest could hardly meet the condition of obligation as well. Like Kant in the Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, therefore, Durkheim concluded that experience has nothing to teach us about the moral law.

迪尔凯姆抱怨说，早期界定道德法则的努力的问题在于，它们通常不能满足这些条件中的一个或多个。例如，54岁的功利主义者将道德法则建立在利益之上; 但是，与他后来对功利主义的批判不同，涂尔干坚持认为，利益本质上是个人的、可变的和主观的ーー也就是说，一种或多或少随着个人、国家或历史时期的不同而立即产生的快乐。例如，伊壁鸠鲁凭什么断定他的快乐是每个人的快乐？因此，功利主义的道德法则的定义不能满足普遍性的条件; 由于没有什么比我们自己的个人利益更难被认可，基于个人利益的道德法则也不能满足义务的条件。因此，就像道德形上学探本中的康德一样，迪尔凯姆得出的结论是，经验没有教给我们任何关于道德法则的东西。

The alternative of basing the moral law on a “natural moral sentiment’’ is subject to at least four objections.[55](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark66) First, the sentiment is hardly infallible, leading us into error as often as into truth, and we have no way of knowing when it’s false and when not. Second, a moral law based on sentiment could hardly be obligatory, for unlike our reason, our feelings are almost irresistible. We cannot be “commanded” to love someone, for example, and the theory of moral sentiments is thus incompatible with the notion of obligation already described. Third, a moral law based on the feeling of sympathy depends heavily on the presence of at least one other person (i.e., on society); but social conditions are always contingent, while the moral law must be such as to be independent of particular conditions or situations. Finally, the theory of a moral sentiment mistakes the effect for the cause. If I instinctively like one person rather than another, Durkheim argued, this is because the ®rst respects the moral law, while the second doesn’t. In other words, we have sympathy for certain people because they are good, not the reverse.

将道德法则建立在“自然的道德情感”之上的替代方案至少有四个反对理由。55首先，这种情感几乎不可能永远正确，它会导致我们误入歧途，而且我们无法知道它什么时候是错误的，什么时候不是。其次，基于感情的道德法则几乎不可能是强制性的，因为与我们的理性不同，我们的感情几乎是不可抗拒的。例如，我们不能被“命令”去爱一个人，因此，道德情操论与我们已经描述过的义务概念是不相容的。第三，基于同情感的道德法则在很大程度上依赖于至少一个其他人的存在(即社会) ; 但社会条件总是有条件的，而道德法则必须独立于特定的条件或情况。最后，道德情操的理论错误的影响的原因。涂尔干认为，如果我本能地喜欢一个人而不是另一个人，那是因为前者尊重道德法则，而后者不尊重道德法则。换句话说，我们同情某些人是因为他们是好人，而不是相反。

Durkheim’s students were thus led almost irresistibly to Kant’s initial, more formal dehnition of the moral law — i.e., “Act according to a maxim such that you can always wish that it be a universal law.’’ And it is here that Durkheim’s lectures on ethics become especially interesting, for he refused to accept the Kantian distinction between “hypothetical” and “categorical” imperatives. A hypothetical imperative, according to Kant, is simply a command that must be obeyed if we are to realize a given end. A categorical imperative, by contrast, commands unconditionally, and has its end in itself. For an action to be moral, therefore, it is not enough that it merely conform to the moral law; on the contrary, the action must be done only out of respect for the moral law, simply because the law commands it — i.e., for its own sake. But an imperative that is truly and absolutely categorical, Durkheim objected, is simply impossible — i.e., we always want to know why we should act in a certain way, a maxim of action must always act on us through some kind of motive if it is to be efficacious. In short, we need to have an interest (in the largest sense) in the actions we perform. Second, we rather clearly do have a reason to respect the moral law — i.e., a reason that is implicit within the categorical imperative and transforms it into a hypothetical imperative. Briefly, we should act in such a way that the maxim of our actions can be elevated into a universal law if we truly want to be human beings. Durkheim’s third argument — despite Kant’s claim that the moral law should be purely formal — was that the later formulations of the categorical imperative in fact granted it this material content: “Act in such a way that you always treat human beings — either yourself or others — as an end and never as a means.’’ The end of the moral law, therefore, lies not just in itself, but in respect for the human personality. A purely formal morality, Durkheim concluded, is not far from being an empty morality; and Kant was able to avoid this consequence only by contradicting his own system.

因此，迪尔凯姆的学生几乎不可抗拒地被引导到康德最初更为正式的对道德法则的否定ーー即“根据一条格言行事，这样你就可以一直希望它是一条普遍法则。”正是在这里，涂尔干的伦理学讲座变得特别有趣，因为他拒绝接受康德对“假设”和“绝对”命令的区分。根据康德的观点，假设命令只是一个命令，如果我们要实现给定的目标，就必须服从命令。相比之下，定言令式无条件地发号施令，自有其目的。因此，一个行为要成为道德行为，仅仅遵守道德法则是不够的; 相反，这个行为必须仅仅出于对道德法则的尊重，仅仅是因为法律要求它——也就是说，为了它自己的目的。但是涂尔干反对说，一个真正绝对绝对的命令是不可能的ーー也就是说，我们总是想知道为什么我们应该以某种方式行动，一个行动准则必须总是通过某种动机对我们行动，如果它是有效的。简而言之，我们需要(在最大意义上)对我们所执行的行动感兴趣。其次，我们显然有理由尊重道德法则ーー也就是说，一个隐含在定言令式之中的理由，并将其转化为一种假设的命令。简而言之，如果我们真的想成为人类，我们的行动准则就应该被提升为一条普遍规律。迪尔凯姆的第三个论点ーー尽管康德声称道德法应该是纯粹形式化的ーー是后来的定言令式公式实际上赋予了道德法以这样的物质内容: “以这样的方式行事，你总是把人类ーー无论是你自己还是他人ーー当作一个目的，而绝不是一种手段。”因此，道德法则的终结不仅在于其本身，而且在于对人格的尊重。涂尔干总结道，一个纯粹形式上的道德，离一个空洞的道德并不遥远; 康德只有通过与他自己的体系相矛盾才能避免这种后果。

Durkheim thus asked the Aristotelian question ± what is a human being for? The answer to this “functional” question about human beings, he insisted, will be the moral law, for that law simply commands us to advance toward the realization of our end or purpose. Durkheim’s first formulation of the moral law was thus: “Advance toward your end.’’ But what is our end? Today, Durkheim answered, each of us is essentially — albeit incompletely and imperfectly — a person. To advance toward our end is thus to develop, complete, and perfect our personality, yielding Durkheim’s second formulation of the moral law: “Act always toward the end of developing your personality.” But what is a person? As we have already seen, the first, most essential condition of being a person is to be free — i.e., to be the cause of one's own actions. The opposite of the person is thus the thing — i.e., something that has no initiative, receives its movement from outside, but does not place itself in movement. The person, by contrast, is able to remove himself from external constraints, and to draw all his action from himself. As such, the person is no longer condemned to see himself used as a means — either in relation to external things, or by other human beings. Hence Durkheim’s third formulation of the moral law: “Act always in a way to treat your person as an end in itself, and never as a means.''

涂尔干因此提出了亚里士多德的问题 ± 人类的意义是什么？他坚持认为，这个关于人类的“功能性”问题的答案将是道德法则，因为道德法则只是命令我们朝着实现我们的目的或目的前进。涂尔干对道德法则的第一个表述是这样的: “向你的目标前进。”但我们的目的是什么？涂尔干回答说，今天，我们每个人本质上都是一个人，尽管不完全、不完美。因此，朝着我们的目标前进就是发展、完善和完善我们的人格，从而产生涂尔干道德法则的第二个表述: “始终朝着发展你的人格的目标行动。”但什么是人呢？正如我们已经看到的，成为一个人的首要条件是自由ーー也就是成为自己行为的原因。因此，人的对立面就是事物ーー也就是说，没有主动性的事物，从外部接收它的运动，但是它本身并不处于运动之中。相比之下，一个人能够摆脱外部的约束，并从自己身上吸取所有的行动。因此，这个人不再注定要看到自己被当作一种手段ーー无论是在与外部事物的关系上，还是被其他人类所利用。因此迪尔凯姆对道德法则的第三个表述是: “行为总是以某种方式来对待你的人本身，而不是作为一种手段。”

These first three formulations of the moral law, Durkheim admitted, do not yet remove us from the self, from egoism. We are commanded to respect our own personality, but we have not yet discovered a rule to govern our relations with other human beings. But if we remember that the moral law is universal, Durkheim continued, we will see that not only ourselves, but all other human beings as well, should develop their personalities — i.e., treat their person as an end, and not as a means. To strike a blow at the personality of others is to presume that the law applies to us but not to them — something that contradicts the universality of the law. Durkheim thus arrived at the “definitive” formulation of the moral law — i.e., “Act always in a way to treat the human personality, everywhere it is encountered, as an end, and never as a means.'' Finally, Durkheim observed, this formulation helps us to see how the moral law, although universal, can vary from one individual to another. We all realize our personality by advancing toward our ends; but we don’t all understand our ends in the same way. The universality of the law is thus expressed in diverse and sometimes contradictory forms.

涂尔干承认，道德法则的前三个公式，还没有把我们从自我、利己主义中移除。我们被要求尊重自己的个性，但是我们还没有找到一条规则来管理我们与其他人的关系。但是如果我们记住道德法则是普遍的，涂尔干继续说道，我们将会看到不仅仅是我们自己，还有其他所有的人类，都应该发展他们的个性ーー也就是说，把他们的个性当作一种目的，而不是一种手段。打击他人的人格就是假定法律只适用于我们，而不适用于他们——这与法律的普遍性相矛盾。因此，涂尔干得出了道德法则的“确定性”表述，即: “行为总是以一种对待人格的方式，无论人格在何处遇到，都以此为目的，而绝不以此为手段。”最后，涂尔干观察到，这个表述帮助我们看到道德法则，虽然是普遍的，可以因人而异。我们都是通过向目标前进来认识自己的个性的，但是我们并不都以同样的方式理解我们的目标。因此，法律的普遍性表现为多种形式，有时甚至是相互矛盾的形式。

The foundation of the moral law is thus the idea of finality, which presents a double advantage over the others described: first, the idea of finality immediately implies the action in question, without which the calculation of interest would have to intervene, and also without passion playing a role; and second, the idea of finality does not command an absurd and impossible form of moral conduct. This conception of our end necessarily implies the will to realize it; but unlike Kant’s “barbarous” ethics, our conception of the moral law still allows us to aspire to happiness. Our end, of course, is not happiness, but rather the development of our personality; but the necessary consequence of the realization of our end will, in fact, be happiness. Where Kant saw a radical antinomy (presumably between duty and happiness), Durkheim saw only a harmony, which in no way compromises the dignity of the moral law.

因此，道德法律的基础是终结的概念，它比其他所描述的概念具有双重优势: 首先，终结的概念立即意味着有关的行动，如果没有这种行动，利益的计算将不得不介入，也没有激情发挥作用; 其次，终结的概念并不要求一种荒谬和不可能的道德行为形式。我们的目的这个概念必然意味着实现它的意愿; 但不同于康德的“野蛮”伦理学，我们的道德法则的概念仍然允许我们渴望幸福。当然，我们的目的不是幸福，而是我们个性的发展，而是实现我们目的的必然结果，事实上，就是幸福。在康德看到一个根本的矛盾(可能在责任和幸福之间)的地方，涂尔干看到的只是一种和谐，这种和谐绝不会损害道德法则的尊严。

From this neo-Kantian redescription of the moral law, the more traditional vocabulary of ethics - e.g., duty, good, virtue, right, justice, etc. - followed quite naturally. “Duty” is the obligation to respect the law - i.e., to advance our end. The “good” is simply the end itself — i.e., the development of our personality. Unlike Kant, for whom the idea of the good was a consequence of the idea of duty, Durkheim thus insisted that the good is prior to duty — i.e., we should do our duty because the moral law is good.

从这种对道德法则的新康德主义重新描述中，更为传统的伦理词汇——例如，责任、善、德、权利、正义等——自然而然地随之而来。“责任”是尊重法律的义务——也就是说，推进我们的目标。“好”只是目的本身ーー也就是我们个性的发展。与康德不同，迪尔凯姆坚持认为“善”优先于“义务”，也就是说，我们应该履行我们的义务，因为道德法则是善的。

“Virtue” is the constant practice of duty — i.e., a disposition or habitual activity in the sense described by Aristotle; and this in turn requires the exercise of a “good will’’ — i.e., first, to dismiss sensible motives that interfere with our reason, and prevent us from clearly and sincerely seeing our end; and second, to apply the judgment of reason under the moral law. But, pace Kant, it is irrational to condemn people for their possession of those sentiments that assist virtue.

“美德”是对责任的不断实践ーー即，亚里士多德所描述的意义上的性情或习惯性行为; 而这反过来又需要“善意”的行使ーー即，首先，摒弃干扰我们理性的明智动机，阻止我们清楚而真诚地看到我们的目的; 其次，运用道德法则下的理性判断。但是，康德认为，谴责人们拥有那些有助于美德的情感是不理性的。

“Right” is an authority to which we occasionally find ourselves entrusted; and it is a moral authority in the sense that is respected independently of any material means. Where, then, does “right” come from? In the state of nature, Hobbes argued, the right of each man is as extensive as his own strength; but under these circumstances human life is constantly threatened. Since our most active instinct is self-preservation, we agree reciprocally to abandon a part of these primitive rights in order to respect each other’s security, creating a new “right” based upon convention. To remove this right from the capricious wills and fantasies of individuals, a monarch is invested with absolute power, to guarantee the permanencies of the contract. In short, for Hobbes, “right” has its origin in self-interest, and rests on a convention that is guaranteed by a man ar med with absolute power.

“权利”是一种权威，我们偶尔会发现自己受到这种权威的委托; 在某种意义上，它是一种道德权威，不依赖于任何物质手段而受到尊重。那么，“正确”从何而来呢？霍布斯认为，在自然状态下，每个人的权利和他自己的力量一样广泛; 但在这种情况下，人的生命不断受到威胁。由于我们最活跃的本能是自我保存，我们同意相互放弃这些原始权利的一部分，以尊重彼此的安全，创造一种基于惯例的新“权利”。为了消除个人反复无常的意志和幻想中的这种权利，君主被赋予了绝对的权力，以保证合同的永久性。简而言之，对于霍布斯来说，“权利”起源于自身利益，并建立在一个由拥有绝对权力的人所保证的惯例之上。

Durkheim agreed with Hobbes that an individual — whatever strength he might have — is quite fragile, and an insufficient guardian of right. With Locke, however, Durkheim wondered what good it can do to remove right from the dangers of the crowd, and place it in the hands of a single man. The will of a single person or the traditions of his family are not sufficient guarantees of right; on the contrary, there would be more security in leaving the enforcement of the contract in the hands of the community. Moreover — assuming that we agree with Hobbes that strength is the foundation of right — what is “right”? Cousin said that it is nothing else but the accountability of duty — e.g., others have the duty to respect my life, and I thus have the right to require others to respect their duty. My right would thus be based on the duty that others have in relation to me. But where does this right come from? How is it that I have the right to require others to perform their duties? Is it our function to make virtue thrive in the world? If so, my right to require that others perform their duties (e.g., charity) leads us directly to socialism — and to the destruction of individual freedom. Durkheim, by contrast, based the idea of right on our duties, not those of others. As we have seen, we each have duties under the moral law — i.e., to develop our personality. As a consequence, we also have the right to do everything necessary to accomplish these duties — e.g., if you threaten my person, I have the right to protect it by whatever means possible. “Man has only one right,’’ Durkheim concluded his discussion of theoretical ethics, “that of doing everything which is necessary to accomplish his duty — i.e., to realize his end.’’

迪尔凯姆同意霍布斯的观点，认为个体ーー不管他有多大的力量ーー都是相当脆弱的，是一个不充分的权利守护者。然而，对于洛克来说，迪尔凯姆想知道把权利从人群的危险中解脱出来，把它交到一个人的手中有什么好处。单个人的意愿或其家庭的传统不能充分保障权利; 相反，将执行合同的任务交由社区来执行会更有保障。此外ーー假设我们同意霍布斯的观点，即力量是权利的基础ーー什么是“权利”？表哥说，这不是别的，只是责任的问题ーー例如，别人有责任尊重我的生命，我因此有权要求别人尊重他们的责任。因此，我的权利将基于其他人对我的义务。但这种权利从何而来？我怎么有权利要求别人履行职责？我们的职责是使美德在世界上茁壮成长吗？如果是这样的话，我要求他人履行职责的权利(例如，慈善)直接导致我们走向社会主义ーー以及个人自由的毁灭。相比之下，涂尔干的权利观念是建立在我们的义务之上的，而不是其他人的义务。正如我们所看到的，根据道德法则，我们每个人都有责任ーー也就是说，发展我们的个性。因此，我们也有权利尽一切必要的努力来履行这些职责ーー例如，如果你威胁我的人，我有权利用一切可能的手段来保护他。“人类只有一项权利,”迪尔凯姆在他关于理论伦理学的讨论中总结道，“那就是尽一切必要的努力来完成自己的职责ーー也就是实现自己的目标。”

This theoretical vocabulary in turn yielded four sets of injunctions — individual, domestic, civic, and social — applied to certain practical conditions of human life. To know what duties we owe to ourselves, for example, we need only to apply the general formula of the moral law to the particular case of an individual removed from social relations with others. We should always strive to develop our personality, for example, to respect and perfect ourselves and not fall into dependence on things. Considering Durkheim’s later interests, it is worth noting that here the moral law yields an injunction against suicide, for three reasons: first, we have other individual duties to fulfill (e.g., the development of our intelligence, sensibility, activity, etc.), which require the conservation of our bodies; second, in so far as suicide is an attempt to avoid pain, it presumes that the person is an instrument for pleasure — something contrary to the moral law; and third, suicide prevents us from performing our social duties — i.e., our duties towards others. Here, Durkheim’s definition of “suicide” was as inclusive as that in Le Suicide (1897) — e.g., the slow death caused by asceticism, privation, and/or voluntary suffering, for example, is just as immoral as its sudden counterpart; and the “courageous and honorable’’ death of Cato — an example of altruistic suicide in the later work — appears here in defense of the proposition that suicide is not necessarily an act of cowardice. But on the whole, it’s dif®cult to imagine a less sociological treatment of suicide.

这个理论词汇反过来又产生了适用于人类生活某些实际情况的四套命令: 个人的、家庭的、公民的和社会的。例如，要知道我们对自己负有什么样的责任，我们只需要将道德法则的一般公式应用于个人脱离与他人的社会关系的特殊情况。我们应该始终努力发展我们的个性，例如，尊重和完善自己，而不是陷入依赖的东西。考虑到涂尔干后来的兴趣，值得注意的是，这里的道德法则产生了一个禁止自杀的禁令，有三个原因: 第一，我们有其他个人义务要履行(例如，我们的智力、感知力、活动等的发展) ，这需要我们保护我们的身体; 第二，如果自杀是一种试图避免痛苦的尝试，它假定这个人是一种快乐的工具ー某种违反道德法则的东西; 第三，自杀阻止我们履行我们的社会义务ー即我们对他人的义务。在这里，迪尔凯姆对“自杀”的定义与《自杀》(1897)中的定义一样具有包容性ーー例如，由禁欲主义、匮乏和/或自愿受苦引起的缓慢死亡，与它的突然对应物一样不道德; 而卡托的“勇敢而光荣的”死亡ーー后期作品中利他主义自杀的一个例子ーー出现在这里，是为了捍卫自杀不一定是懦弱行为的命题。但总的来说，很难想象一个不那么社会学的自杀治疗方法。

Quite aside from our duty simply to preserve ourselves, however, Durkheim insisted that we have duties to our souls — i.e., to perfect our intelligence, our sensibility, and our will. The natural end of the intelligence, for example, is truth. This means that lying was proscribed by Durkheim no less than by Kant; but in the Sens lectures, it also means that we are required to develop our intelligence. Explicitly attacking Rousseau’s notion that the progress of civilization has undermined morality, therefore, Durkheim insisted that the greater a man’s intelligence, the greater his morality. For intelligence is a part of our nature, and there can be no antinomy between nature and morality; thus, we can give ourselves entirely to the arts and the sciences, without fear of contradicting the moral law. The duties we owe to our sensibility are analogous to those we owe to our intelligence; but our sensibility, unlike our intelligence, is comprised of sometimes contradictory passions, emotions, and inclinations, and we cannot develop all of them simultaneously. Our inclinations, therefore, must be developed harmoniously, some being subordinated to others; and the inclination to which all others should be subordinated is that of human dignity. To exercise our will, Durkheim concluded, is to work; and thus work, under all its forms, is a moral duty.

然而，除了保护我们自己的责任之外，涂尔干还坚持认为，我们对自己的灵魂负有责任ーー也就是说，要完善我们的智力、情感和意志。例如，智慧的自然结果就是真理。这意味着涂尔干和康德都禁止说谎; 但是在森斯的讲座中，这也意味着我们需要发展我们的智力。因此，迪尔凯姆坚持认为，一个人的智力越高，他的道德就越高。因为智力是我们天性的一部分，自然和道德之间不可能有矛盾，因此，我们可以把自己完全献给艺术和科学，而不用担心违背道德规律。我们对感性的责任类似于我们对智力的责任; 但是我们的感性不同于我们的智力，它有时由矛盾的激情、情感和倾向组成，我们不能同时发展所有这些。因此，我们的倾向必须和谐地发展，有些是从属于其他人的; 所有其他人都应该从属于的倾向是人类尊严的倾向。迪尔凯姆总结说，行使我们的意志就是工作; 因此，工作，无论其形式如何，都是一种道德义务。

The family, Durkheim’s treatment of domestic morality begins, is the only institution which does a good job of raising children, for there is a natural, instinctual love of parents for their children which, though later transformed into a more reasoned affection, can never be replaced; and the family is also the ®rst school of disinterestedness, for it is within the family that the child, who would otherwise fall prey to egoism, learns that he must occasionally make sacri®ces and devotions ± things that society will later demand. Apparently recalling what he had learned from Fustel, Durkheim added that the ancient city was comprised of families, and the earliest nation-states of several cities. “Society,” Durkheim continued, “is like a large organism,” in which the brain commands, and the actions of smaller, “secondary centers” are subordinated to the brain. Families are such secondary centers, and without them, the actions of the brain could never be transmitted to the whole, and society would be destroyed at its base.

涂尔干对家庭道德的处理开始于家庭，家庭是唯一一个在养育孩子方面做得很好的机构，因为父母对孩子有一种天然的、本能的爱，尽管后来这种爱变成了一种更合理的爱，但是永远不会被取代; 家庭也是第一个公正的学校，因为在家庭中，孩子，否则会成为利己主义的牺牲品，学会了他必须偶尔做出牺牲和奉献 ± 这些社会后来要求的东西。迪尔凯姆显然想起了他从 Fustel 学到的东西，他补充说，这座古老的城市是由家庭和几个城市中最早的民族国家组成的。“社会,”涂尔干继续说，“就像一个大的有机体,”在这个有机体中，大脑发号施令，而较小的“次要中心”的行动从属于大脑。家庭就是这样的次要中心，没有它们，大脑的活动就永远无法传递给整体，社会就会在其基础上被摧毁。

Durkheim's discussion of the duties of parents to their children is interesting for its opposition to the theory of education presented in Rousseau’s Emile (1762) — a work in which Durkheim later took far more serious interest (see chapter 5, pp. 285—90). According to Rousseau, the way to educate best is to educate least. The influence of the father — already corrupted by civilization — should be minimized, and the child raised far from the towns and cities. For the child is good by nature, and should thus be left to the freedom of his natural instincts. The apparent alternative to Rousseau’s theory, Durkheim observed, is to give parents an authority as absolute as possible, so that they might inculcate all their ideas and habits in their children. This alternative theory, Durkheim argued, is immoral, for it violates the “person” of the child which, though in an undeveloped condition, already exists. But Rousseau’s theory, which grants the child much greater freedom, is chimerical. The child is neither good nor bad, Durkheim insisted, for these things are settled only by heredity and circumstances; and the “method of abstention,” which provides the child neither with instruction nor education, leaves him without weapons when he reaches the age of struggle. So we must prepare the child, which to Durkheim meant providing the child with habits; and for this, we must use authority — “without excess,’’ Durkheim cautioned, “but in order to prepare the future of the human personality in the child’’ (1884: 456). The parents thus have the duty of providing the child with material and moral support, but always with the goal of preparing the child to be a free human being — again, a “person” who is the cause of his own actions.

涂尔干关于父母对孩子的责任的讨论很有意思，因为它反对卢梭的《埃米尔》(1762)中提出的教育理论——涂尔干后来对这本书更感兴趣(见第5章，第285-90页)。按照卢梭的说法，最好的教育方式就是最少的教育。父亲的影响ーー已经被文明腐化ーー应该尽量减少，孩子应该在远离城镇和城市的地方长大。因为孩子的本性是善良的，因此应该让他的本性自由发挥。涂尔干指出，卢梭理论的另一个明显的选择是，给予父母尽可能绝对的权威，这样他们就可以把自己的所有思想和习惯灌输给孩子。涂尔干认为，这种另类理论是不道德的，因为它违背了儿童的“人格”，尽管这种“人格”还处于未发展的状态，但已经存在。但是卢梭给予孩子更大自由的理论是空想的。涂尔干坚持认为，这个孩子既不好也不坏，因为这些事情只能通过遗传和环境来解决; “禁欲的方法”既没有给孩子提供教育，也没有给他提供教育，使他到了奋斗的年龄时没有武器。因此，我们必须为孩子做好准备，对涂尔干来说，这意味着要给孩子养成习惯; 为此，我们必须使用权威ーー“不能过分,”涂尔干警告说，“但是为了准备孩子人格的未来”(1884:456)。因此，父母有责任为孩子提供物质和精神上的支持，但总是以培养孩子成为一个自由的人为目标ーー再次强调，一个“人”是他自己行为的原因。

Noting that some philosophers (e.g., Hobbes, Bossuet, Rousseau, etc.) considered society “arti®cial” and “counter to nature,'' Durkheim's account of civic morality advanced the argument that society is a part of nature ± a view that formed at least a part of his later, social realist vocabulary. First, altruistic sentiments ± as we've already seen ± are as natural as their egoistic counterparts, so that the “voice of nature'' urges us to associate with one another; second, we are social animals, born into the “natural society'' of the family; and third, Durkheim again appealed to Claude Bernard, who had described man as composed of millions of anatomical elements possessing their own individuality and vitality. What does this prove, Durkheim asked? Briefly, that isolation itself is unnatural, that everyone has a need for association. “The large society that unites individuals is no less natural,'' Durkheim insisted, “than a small society which constitutes each of these individuals. The larger society, like the smaller, is a natural organism which has its brain, its nerves, its vessels, etc., enjoying only a greater complexity” (1884: 461). The view that society is a part of nature, therefore, was a part of Durkheim's vocabulary from the start; but here “nature” referred to the psychological fact of altruistic sentiments. The quite different notion that social facts are concrete, complex things — characterized by externality and constraint, and to be studied comme des choses — was not yet in evidence.

注意到一些哲学家(例如霍布斯、 Bossuet、卢梭等)认为社会是“人为的”和“违背自然的”，涂尔干对公民道德的解释推进了这样一个论点: 社会是自然的一部分 ± a 观点，至少构成了他后来的社会现实主义词汇的一部分。首先，正如我们已经看到的那样，利他主义的情感和利己主义的情感一样自然，因此“自然之声”促使我们彼此联系; 其次，我们是社会动物，出生于家庭的“自然社会”; 第三，迪尔凯姆再次吸引了克劳德 · 伯纳德，他描述人类是由数以百万计的解剖元素组成的，拥有自己的个性和活力。涂尔干问，这能证明什么？简而言之，孤立本身是不自然的，每个人都需要联系。迪尔凯姆坚持认为: “把个体联系在一起的大社会，与构成每个个体的小社会一样，都是自然而然的。”。较大的社会就像较小的社会一样，是一个自然的有机体，它有自己的大脑、神经、血管等等，只享受更大的复杂性”(1884:461)。因此，认为社会是自然的一部分的观点，从一开始就是迪尔凯姆词汇的一部分; 但在这里，“自然”指的是利他主义情感的心理事实。社会事实是具体的、复杂的事物ーー具有拥有属性的外部性和约束性，研究起来就像选择一样ーー这种截然不同的观点还没有得到证实。

Why, he asked, do men unite with each other this way? Briefly, because it is natural to them, and because they cannot be selfsufficient. The life of the modern European, Durkheim explained, is such that no individual alone can ful®ll the multiple functions it demands. The process upon which we depend, therefore, is the division of labor — i.e., each individual, charged with a special function, ful®lls it better and more quickly, and thus acquires the products necessary to his life while also exchanging the products of his labor. Lest we jump to the conclusion that we are but a short step from Durkheim's ®rst major book, however, it's important to recognize that Durkheim's source here was Claude-Frederic Bastiat (1801—50), whose posthumously published Harmonie economique argued — like Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776) — that the division of labor was important primarily because it transformed the pursuit of private interest into public goods. It was to displace this preoccupation with the purely economic bene®ts of the division of labor, of course, that Durkheim would write De la division du travail social (1984: 1—7).

他问道，为什么人们要这样团结起来呢？简而言之，因为这对他们来说是自然的，因为他们不能自给自足。涂尔干解释说，现代欧洲人的生活是这样的，没有一个人能够独自完成它所要求的多重功能。因此，我们赖以生存的过程就是劳动分工ーー也就是说，每个个体都被赋予了一种特殊的功能，它能更好、更快地满足我们的需求，从而在交换劳动成果的同时获得生活所必需的产品。然而，为了避免我们过早地得出结论，认为我们离涂尔干的第一本重要著作只有一步之遥，我们有必要认识到，涂尔干的出处是克劳德-弗雷德里克 · 巴斯夏(Claude-Frederic Bastiat，1801-50) ，他在去世后出版的《和谐经济学》(Harmony economics)ーー就像亚当 · 斯密(Adam Smith)的《国富论》(Wealth of Nations，1776)ーー提出，劳动分工之所以重要，主要是因为它将追求私人利益转化为公共产品。当然，涂尔干写《社会劳动分工论》(1984:1-7)就是为了将这种关注转移到纯粹的劳动分工的经济利益上。

The suspicion that the Sens lecturer lacked any sociological sensibilities is deepened still further by his discussion of the function of legal punishment. Some philosophers, Durkheim observed, have argued that the foundation of punishment is expiation ± i.e., the person who has violated the law must be punished in order to expiate his fault. But how does a punishment erase a fault? By what right does a government impose virtue on its citizens? Does it even have the means to do so? For to expiate a fault, Durkheim observed, we must know the intention ± which alone makes the act moral or immoral ± as well as the act itself. A punishment, Durkheim thus argued, can never be an expiation; and neither can it “improve” the guilty (something for which, in any case, we are not responsible). For punishment often makes people worse rather than better: “To terrify a man,” Durkheim insisted, “is not to improve his heart” (1884: 463). The foundation of penality, Durkheim thus concluded, is the right of a society ± no less than an individual person ± to defend itself. In De la division du travail social, of course, Durkheim advanced a powerful and controversial theory of punishment in which vengeance and expiation were treated as among its major functions (1984: 46±7).

对森斯讲师缺乏任何社会学敏感性的怀疑由于他对法律惩罚功能的讨论而进一步加深。涂尔干注意到，一些哲学家认为，惩罚的基础是赎罪，也就是说，违反法律的人必须受到惩罚，以弥补他的过错。但是惩罚怎样才能消除过错呢？政府凭什么把美德强加给公民？它有这样做的手段吗？涂尔干指出，为了弥补过错，我们必须了解行为本身以及行为本身的意图，只有意图才能使行为道德化或不道德化。迪尔凯姆因此认为，惩罚永远不能作为一种补偿; 它也不能“改善”罪犯(在任何情况下，我们都不必为此负责)。因为惩罚往往使人变得更坏而不是更好: “吓唬一个人,”涂尔干坚持认为，“不是改善他的心”(1884:463)。迪尔凯姆由此得出结论，刑罚的基础是一个社会不亚于个人自卫的权利。当然，在《社会劳动分工论》中，涂尔干提出了一个强有力的、有争议的惩罚理论，其中报复和补偿被视为其主要功能之一(1984:46 ± 7)。

What is the function of government itself? According to the socialist theory ± of which Durkheim found a “complete expression” in Rousseau’s Contrat social (1762) ± all citizens have abdicated their rights, individuality, and “personality” by entering society, and thus they belong to the State. Since the ends of society transcend those of the individual, the government is granted absolute sovereignty as long as it serves society’s ends. The alternative is liberal or individualist theory ± i.e., in which society is an abstraction, and the individual alone is a reality. Here the function of government is to protect citizens against one another, and to safeguard the individuality of each. The government exercises authority and intervenes in the lives of citizens only to obligate each individual to respect the rights and liberty of others. The socialist theory, Durkheim responded, is “obviously immoral’’ ± i.e., it undermines the personality of the individual, by using it as a means to the realization of its own ends. The compensation offered by Rousseau ± i.e., the renunciation of individual freedom in order to beneht from an association of which one is also a member ± is insufficient; for the fact that others renounce their personality doesn’t mitigate the fact that my renunciation (as well as theirs) is immoral from the moment it is performed. The liberal or individualist doctrine, by contrast, is not immoral; but against the notion that individual ends alone have value, Durkheim insisted that each society, like each individual, does have an end that is appropriate to it. “By this alone,” he explained, “that we are to the west of Germany, to the north of Spain and of Italy, we have certain appropriate interests, which are not those of other countries. We have an end which is ours, other than that of England, Switzerland, or Italy” (1884: 465). The proper function of government is thus not simply to protect the personality of individual citizens, but also to lead each society to its proper end.

政府本身的职能是什么？根据迪尔凯姆在卢梭的《社会契约论》(1762)中发现的“完全表达”的社会主义理论，所有公民都通过进入社会而放弃了他们的权利、个性和“人格”，因此他们属于国家。由于社会的目的超越个人的目的，只要为社会的目的服务，政府就被赋予绝对主权。另一种选择是自由主义或个人主义理论，也就是说，社会是一个抽象概念，个人本身就是一个现实。在这里，政府的职能是保护公民免受他人的伤害，保护每个人的个性。政府行使权力，干预公民的生活，只是为了使每个人有义务尊重他人的权利和自由。迪尔凯姆回应说，社会主义理论是“明显不道德的”，也就是说，它通过利用社会主义理论作为实现自身目标的手段，破坏了个体的人格。卢梭提供的补偿，即放弃个人自由，以便从一个自己也是其成员的社团中获益，是不够的; 因为其他人放弃他们的个性，并不能减轻我的放弃(以及他们的)从一开始就是不道德的这一事实。相比之下，自由主义或个人主义学说并不是不道德的; 但是，与个人目的本身就有价值的观念相反，涂尔干坚持认为，每个社会，就像每个个人一样，确实有一个适合它的目的。“仅凭这一点,”他解释说，“我们在德国的西部、西班牙的北部和意大利的北部，我们就拥有某些适当的利益，而不是其他国家的利益。除了英格兰、瑞士或意大利，我们有我们自己的目的”(1884:465)。因此，政府的适当职能不仅仅是保护公民个人的人格，而且还要引导每个社会走向其适当的目标。

Discussions of the most general obligations of social life commonly distinguish between positive duties: those which command an action (e.g., doing good to others), and might be fulhlled in a variety of ways to various degrees; and negative duties: i.e., those which forbid an action (e.g., killing someone), and are both specihc and absolute, admitting of no degrees in performance. Durkheim acknowledged that the distinction holds some justihcation, but he questioned the tendency to assume that negative duties were somehow more obligatory than their positive counterparts, and that positive acts more meritorious because they are less obligatory. This assumption, Durkheim argued, derives from the fact that positive duties - less important to society — have no civil sanction; but the moral law — and here again the Sens lecturer sounds more like Kant than the later Durkheim — transcends the laws of society. “All duties,” Durkheim here insisted, “derive from the moral law, which confers on all of them the same character of obligation. It is absolute in itself, and by consequence, there is no distinction to make in its application” (1884: 472—3).

关于社会生活中最普遍的义务的讨论通常区分积极的义务: 那些要求一个行动(例如，对他人做好事) ，并且可能以不同程度的各种方式完成的义务; 和消极的义务: 即，那些禁止一个行动(例如，杀死某人)的义务，既特殊又绝对，承认没有任何程度的表现。涂尔干承认，这种区分有一定道理，但他质疑认为消极义务在某种程度上比积极义务更具有义务性的倾向，以及认为积极行为更有价值，因为它们没有那么具有义务性的倾向。涂尔干认为，这种假设来自于这样一个事实: 积极的义务——对社会不那么重要——没有民事制裁; 但道德法则——在这里，Sens 的讲师听起来更像康德，而不是后来的涂尔干——超越了社会法则。涂尔干在这里坚持说: “所有的义务都源于道德法则，道德法则赋予所有的义务以同样的性质。它本身是绝对的，因此在应用中没有区别”(1884:472ー3)。

Durkheim’s example of a “negative” duty was justice — i.e., not “undermining the personality” of others, including their lives, sensibility, intelligence, and activity. To respect the sensibility of others, for example, means to be polite. But what do we do when this duty conflicts with the duty of truthfulness? Objecting strongly to both Rousseau and Kant, Durkheim insisted that where the choice is inescapable, we might lie if the truth would cause great sadness to another human being. To respect the intelligence of others is to let them think and express their ideas — i.e., toleration — something required not only by the moral law, but also required for the progress of science itself. Finally, Durkheim’s notion of the respect for other people’s activity was divided into two parts. To respect activity in itself means to respect the freedom of others, to resist and oppose their subordination or enslavement; and to respect the external conditions of others’ activity means to respect their property ± we can develop our personality only in so far as we can exercise it on external objects.

迪尔凯姆举出的“消极”责任的例子是正义ーー也就是说，不要“破坏他人的个性”，包括他们的生活、情感、智力和活动。例如，尊重他人的感性意味着要有礼貌。但是，当这种责任与诚实的责任发生冲突时，我们该怎么办呢？迪尔凯姆强烈反对卢梭和康德，他坚持认为，如果选择是不可避免的，我们可能会说谎，如果真相会造成巨大的悲伤，另一个人。尊重他人的智慧就是让他们思考和表达自己的思想ーー即宽容ーー这不仅是道德法则所要求的，也是科学本身进步所要求的。最后，涂尔干关于尊重他人活动的观念分为两部分。尊重活动本身意味着尊重他人的自由，抵制和反对他人的从属或奴役; 尊重他人活动的外部条件意味着尊重他人的财产 ± 我们只有在能够在外部对象上行使我们的个性时才能发展我们的个性。

Quite aside from the negative duty of justice, there is also the more positive duty of charity ± i.e., to do whatever we can to support others, to care for them, and to “enlarge their personality.” Just as justice demands that we respect the sensibility of others by being polite, for example, charity demands that we respect their sensibility through the duty of good will. Where justice requires that we respect others’ intelligence through toleration, the more positive duty of charity requires that we work to enhance this intelligence, by teaching others what we know. And where justice insists that we respect the activity of others by protecting their property, charity demands that we enable our peers to receive property ± i.e., through the giving of alms. Finally, however obligatory these more positive duties, Durkheim insisted that charity should never contradict justice. Our ®rst duty is to do no harm to others, and our second is to aid them.

除了正义的消极义务，慈善还有更积极的义务，也就是说，尽我们所能去支持他人，关心他人，并“扩大他们的个性”正如正义要求我们通过礼貌来尊重他人的感情，例如，慈善要求我们通过善意的义务来尊重他人的感情。当正义要求我们通过宽容尊重他人的智慧时，慈善更积极的义务要求我们通过教导他人我们所知道的来提高这种智慧。正义要求我们通过保护他人的财产来尊重他人的行为，而慈善则要求我们通过施舍使我们的同龄人能够获得财产。最后，无论这些更为积极的义务有多么必要，涂尔干坚持认为慈善永远不应该与正义相抵触。我们的首要职责是不伤害他人，其次是帮助他人。

Historically, Durkheim explained, the great philosophers have followed one of two methods. The empiricist method ± which was followed by Epicurus, Spencer, and reached its “most perfect development” with Mill ± begins by observing human beings and the conditions of their happiness, progresses through induction and generalization, and then develops the moral law from these observations. But as we have already seen, the empiricist method never reaches the universality which is a deter mining characteristic of the moral law. It reaches only local, provisional rules, good for a certain time, and for a limited number of individuals. The a priori method of Kant, by contrast, starts with the abstract concept of a pure moral law and, assuming that the will can act without sensibility, asks what the law of this will should be. But Kant’s method is “imaginary” ± i.e., it is the rule of an ideal, hypothetical activity ± not of human beings as they are. Durkheim reminded his students that his own, more eclectic method was both deductive and experimental. He had begun with a fact of experience ± i.e., moral responsibility ± and then deduced the conditions of moral responsibility ± i.e., the moral law of developing our personality. Durkheim emphasized that, unlike Kant, he had never ignored human nature ± i.e., as a being endowed with sensibility, pursuing its own, distinctive ends. Where Kant had excluded psychology from ethics and Mill had reduced ethics to psychology, Durkheim claimed to have based his ethics on psychology — i.e., “in order to know what man should do, we have asked ourselves what man is.” Psychology tells us that he is a person, he explained, and our ethics thus concludes that he should be a person. As in his later work — albeit in a very different way — Durkheim thus claimed to have done justice to both the a priori and the empiricist approach to ethics, without the disadvantages of either — i.e., moral responsibility (a fact of experience} was his point of departure, while finality (an a priori idea) regulated his ethics.

涂尔干解释说，从历史上看，伟大的哲学家遵循两种方法之一。经验主义方法在伊壁鸠鲁、斯宾塞等人的研究中得到了“最完美的发展”，穆勒的经验主义方法从观察人类及其幸福状况开始，经过归纳和概括，进而发展出道德规律。但正如我们已经看到的，经验主义的方法从未达到普遍性，而普遍性是道德规律的决定性特征。它只能达到局部的、临时的规则，在一定的时间内是有效的，并且只适用于有限的个人。相比之下，康德的先验方法从纯粹道德法则的抽象概念开始，假设意志可以不带感性地行动，问这个意志的法则应该是什么。但是康德的方法是“想象的”，也就是说，它是一个理想的、假设的活动的规则，而不是人类本来的样子。涂尔干提醒他的学生，他自己的，更折衷的方法是演绎和实验。他从一个经验事实开始，也就是道德责任，然后推导出道德责任的条件，也就是发展我们个性的道德法则。涂尔干强调，与康德不同，他从来没有忽视人性，也就是说，作为一个被赋予感性的人，他追求自己独特的目标。康德将心理学排除在伦理学之外，穆勒将伦理学降格为心理学，涂尔干声称他的伦理学建立在心理学的基础上ーー也就是说，“为了知道人应该做什么，我们问自己人是什么。”心理学告诉我们，他是一个人，他解释说，我们的道德因此得出结论，他应该是一个人。正如在他后来的作品中ーー尽管是以一种非常不同的方式ーー迪尔凯姆因此声称，他对先验和经验主义的伦理学方法都做到了公正，没有任何一种方法的缺点ーー也就是说，道德责任(经验的事实)是他的出发点，而最终(一个先验的想法)规范了他的伦理学。

When Durkheim turned from ethics to metaphysics, the significance of his Leibnizian — by contrast with Cartesian — realism became clear. When we say there is a soul, for example, we mean only that, within us, related to our states of consciousness, there is “a principle distinct from the matter we perceive through the senses.” In his earlier lecture on the external world, Durkheim had argued that the idea of extension is contradictory, that the notion of extended matter is thus only an appearance, and the substratum of this appearance must be conceived as forces analogous to ourselves. Durkheim now turned this argument around, suggesting that the principle that we call matter, when it is perceived by the senses, is identical to the principle we call the mind as perceived by the consciousness. This is what we mean, Durkheim insisted, when we say that the soul is “spiritual” — i.e., it is “matter” different from “sensible, extended” matter.

当涂尔干从伦理学转向形而上学时，他的莱布尼兹主义ーー与笛卡尔主义ーー现实主义的意义就变得清晰起来。例如，当我们说有一个灵魂时，我们的意思只是说，在我们内部，与我们的意识状态相关的，有一个“与我们通过感官感知的物质不同的原则。”在迪尔凯姆早期关于外部世界的演讲中，他认为外延的概念是矛盾的，因此外延物质的概念只是一种表象，而这种表象的基础必须被认为是类似于我们自身的力量。涂尔干现在改变了这个论点，提出我们称之为物质的原则，当它被感官感知时，与我们称之为心灵的原则，被意识感知时，是相同的。涂尔干坚持认为，这就是我们所说的灵魂是“精神的”ーー也就是说，它是“物质”，不同于“感性的、延伸的”物质。

Durkheim thus advanced four “special proofs” of the spirituality of the soul, the ®rst three of which demonstrate a contradiction between the nature of mind and that of matter.[56](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark67) First, Durkheim observed, the mind is one, while matter is multiple and indefinitely divisible: second, the mind is identical, while matter is constantly changing; and third, mind is endowed with activity and spontaneity, while matter is inert. These three arguments are analogous to those used by Descartes for the same purpose — i.e., to demonstrate the difference between mind and matter. But Durkheim emphasized that his method was not the same as Descartes' — i.e., the Cartesian arguments depended upon the notion that “two concepts which can be conceived separately belong to different species,'' while Durkheim’s arguments were based on the principle that “two orders of phenomena presenting contradictory characteristics are not related to the same substance.” Durkheim thus argued that his own, Leibnizian position escaped the most common objection made to spiritualism ± i.e., that it accepts the existence of two different kinds of reality. “Our spiritualism,” he emphasized, “admits, on the contrary, that the soul is not a reality of a separate nature, arising suddenly in the scale of beings. The mind finds itself in all degrees, only more or less rudimentary: everything lives,” Durkheim concluded, “everything is animated, everything thinks” (1884: 498).

因此，迪尔凯姆提出了灵魂精神性的四个“特殊证明”，其中前三个证明了心灵的本质和物质的本质之间的矛盾。56首先，迪尔凯姆观察到，心灵是一个，而物质是多重的和无限可分的: 第二，心灵是相同的，而物质是不断变化的; 第三，心灵被赋予了活动性和自发性，而物质是惰性的。这三个论点类似于笛卡尔为了同一个目的而使用的论点ーー也就是说，证明心灵和物质之间的区别。但是迪尔凯姆强调他的方法与笛卡尔的不同ーー也就是说，笛卡尔的论点依赖于“两个可以分别构思的概念属于不同的物种”这一概念，而迪尔凯姆的论点则基于“表现出相互矛盾特征的两种现象秩序与同一实体无关”这一原则迪尔凯姆因此认为，他自己的莱布尼兹立场逃脱了对唯心论最常见的反对意见，即它接受两种不同类型的现实的存在。“我们的唯心主义,”他强调，“相反，承认灵魂不是一个独立的自然现实，突然出现在生命的规模。心灵在各种程度上发现自己，只不过或多或少是最基本的: 一切都是活的,”涂尔干总结道，“一切都是活的，一切都是思考的”(1884:498)。

The scientihc method constantly enjoins us not to multiply causes and/or principles, Durkheim admitted, and materialists have thus attacked spiritualism for admitting two realities, two irreducible principles, provoking an immediate presumption against it. But spiritualism only does this, Durkheim objected, because most spiritualists believe that sensible matter cannot have the property of thought. Recognizing that the essence of things escapes us, Durkheim asked rhetorically, is it conceivable that someday it will be “proved experimentally” that matter is endowed with spontaneity and thought? Durkheim’s initial response to this rhetorical question was to remind his students that his own, Leibnizian form of spiritualism avoids dualism altogether — i.e., reality is always the same. But seen from the outside, it is material, while seen from the inside, it is spirit. The spiritualist hope that sensible matter would one day be shown to think is purely illusory — as Durkheim had just explained in his previous lecture, the constitutive qualities of the mind (e.g., unity, identity, etc.) don’t belong to matter, and the absence of these qualities implies the absence of thought. Materialists also point to the dependence of the psychological on the physiological life; but Durkheim immediately countered by emphasizing the influence of the moral life on our physical health. The reciprocal influence of these two lives on one another is thus incontestable, Durkheim observed, and this indicates that they have the same principle; but we still have no reason to believe that this principle is material rather than spiritual. Finally, materialists insist that thought varies with the brain’s volume, weight, form, quality, quantity of phosphorous, circulation of blood, etc. But these facts, Durkheim argued, are explained just as well if we consider the brain as the condition — and not the cause — of thought; and the condition, Durkheim reminded his students, is simply that without which the cause cannot produce its effect, not the cause itself. What we call “matter,” Durkheim concluded, is only a collection of appearances, and the existing substance that underlies and supports these appearances cannot be reached through the senses.

迪尔凯姆承认，科学方法不断地告诫我们不要增加原因和/或原则，因此唯物主义者攻击唯心主义承认两个现实，两个不可还原的原则，引发了立即反对它的假设。但是涂尔干反对说，唯心论只能做到这一点，因为大多数唯心论者认为，感性的物质不能具有思想的属性。认识到事物的本质逃避了我们，涂尔干反问道，是否可以想象有一天它会被“实验证明”，即物质具有自发性和思维？涂尔干对这个反问的最初反应是提醒他的学生，他自己的莱布尼兹形式的唯心论完全避免二元论ーー也就是说，现实总是相同的。但从外面看，它是物质的，而从内部看，它是精神的。唯灵论者希望有一天，有意义的物质会被证明是纯粹虚幻的ーー正如涂尔干刚刚在他的前一次演讲中解释的那样，心灵的构成性质(例如，统一性、同一性等)不属于物质，这些性质的缺失意味着思想的缺失。唯物主义者也指出心理对生理生活的依赖，但迪尔凯姆立即反驳，强调道德生活对我们身体健康的影响。涂尔干观察到，这两种生命对彼此的相互影响是无可争议的，这表明他们有相同的原则; 但是我们仍然没有理由相信这个原则是物质的而不是精神的。最后，唯物主义者坚持认为，思想随着大脑的体积、重量、形式、质量、磷的数量、血液循环等而变化。但是，迪尔凯姆认为，如果我们把大脑看作思维的条件，而不是原因，这些事实也能得到很好的解释; 迪尔凯姆提醒他的学生，条件就是，没有大脑，原因就不能产生效果，而不是原因本身。迪尔凯姆总结道，我们所谓的“物质”只是表象的集合，支撑这些表象的现有物质不能通过感官获得。

The concluding Sens lectures dealt with metaphysical and moral arguments for the existence of God and divine providence. It's surprising to see Durkheim treating these issues so carefully; but he seems to have taken some theological arguments more seriously than others, and it's important to look at his reasons for doing so. Descartes' argument from the idea of perfection, for example, was rejected on the ground that it presumes that our ideas are the products of external objects ± whether material or transcendent ± and it thus denies our minds the active role that Durkheim's spiritualism had repeatedly insisted they possess. Similarly, while the ontological argument was flatly dismissed on Kantian grounds, Durkheim credited Leibniz with first recognizing that geometric reasoning — i.e., drawing inferences from first principles — has nothing to tell us about the existence of a perfect being. Both the cosmological argument and the more abstract version of the proof by the principle of finality were quickly dispatched; but like Kant, Durkheim seems to have had considerable respect for “physico-theological proof'' (i.e., also known as the teleological argument, or the argument from design).

最后，森斯的讲座探讨了关于上帝和神圣眷顾存在的形而上学和道德论证。看到涂尔干如此认真地处理这些问题令人惊讶; 但是他似乎比其他人更认真地对待一些神学论点，看看他这样做的原因是很重要的。例如，笛卡尔关于完美主义的论证被拒绝，理由是它假定我们的思想是外部事物的产物，不管是物质的还是超越的，因此它否定了我们的思想所具有的迪尔凯姆的唯灵论一再强调的积极作用。同样，虽然这一本体论证明被康德的理由断然驳回，但迪尔凯姆认为莱布尼茨首先认识到几何推理ーー即从第一原理推断ーー没有任何东西能告诉我们完美存在的存在。无论是宇宙论证还是更抽象的终极性原则证明都被迅速推出，但是像康德一样，迪尔凯姆似乎对“物理神学证明”(即，也被称为目的论的证明，或者来自设计的论证)有着相当大的尊重。

The teleological argument begins, Durkheim explained, with the empirical observation that nature presents us with evidence of order, plan, or design. This order is contingent, suggesting that there is a cause that has produced the world, not as a force “fatally engendering'' its effect, but as an intelligence which acts freely. This in turn implies the existence of a designer — i.e., an intelligence coordinating things harmoniously in view of some end. To this, Durkheim added Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason. At the origin of things, according to Leibniz, there was an infinity of “logically possible worlds.'' Who, then, made the choice among all these possibilities? Why was one world chosen from these possibilities, and existence denied to all the others? Such a choice, Leibniz reasoned, implies the existence of an intelligence combined with a will, a supreme person — i.e., God. It was God, therefore, who chose the present world because it is the best; and without God, this choice no longer has “sufficient reason'' (Wiener 1951: 93—6; Durkheim 1884: 527).

迪尔凯姆解释说，目的论的证明开始于实证观察，即自然给我们提供了秩序、计划或设计的证据。这种秩序是偶然的，表明有一种原因产生了世界，不是作为一种“致命的产生”其效果的力量，而是作为一种自由行动的智慧。这反过来又意味着一个设计者的存在ーー也就是说，一种为了某种目的而和谐地协调事物的智慧。对此，涂尔干补充了莱布尼茨的充分理性原则。根据莱布尼茨的观点，在万物起源的时候，存在着无限多的“逻辑上可能的世界”那么，是谁在所有这些可能性中做出了选择呢？为什么从这些可能性中选择了一个世界，而其他所有的可能性都被剥夺了存在的权利？莱布尼茨认为，这样的选择意味着一种智慧与一种意志、一个至高无上的人ーー也就是上帝ーー结合在一起的存在。因此，是上帝选择了现在的世界，因为它是最好的; 没有上帝，这个选择就不再有“充分的理由”(Wiener 1951:93ー6; Durkheim 1884:527)。

All philosophers, Durkheim observed, agree with the first step of the proof: i.e., the universe does reveal a certain order or harmony —

涂尔干观察到，所有的哲学家都同意证明的第一步: 即，宇宙确实揭示了某种秩序或和谐ー

e.g., the “marvelous proportion” between organisms and their environments, as well as the extraordinary coordination of the constituent elements within the organism itself. But mechanists like Spencer, Durkheim observed, explain both as the deterministic consequence of efficient ± rather than final ± causes. The harmony between an organism and its environment, Spencer argues, can be explained by “adaptation” and the “instability of the homogeneous” ± i.e., a homogeneous mass is inherently unstable, so that an organism must differentiate in order to adapt to its environment. The internal coordination of parts is explained by “segregation” ± i.e., the joining together of similar things into distinct systems. Durkheim’s reply to Spencer reaffirmed his earlier commitment to final causes. If an organism is placed in a hostile environment, for example, it may or may not develop the organs necessary to its adaptation. But if it does develop these adaptive organs, Durkheim argued, can this development be explained simply as a consequence of the fact that the organs were necessary? If so, isn’t this proof by the principle of finality? If not, isn’t this development the consequence of mere chance? Moreover, where Spencer’s theory might account for the physical coordination of the parts of an organism (i.e., the reunion of similar elements), it cannot explain their organic coordination ± i.e., their systematization or subordination to a dominant unity In an organism, Durkheim reminded his students, all the parts cooperate in the whole, and this subordination is repeated in each individual organ. In short, the harmony between organisms and their environments and the coordination of the constituent elements within an organism make our appeal to ®nal causes all the more necessary (1884: 542).

例如，有机体与其环境之间的“奇妙比例”，以及有机体内部组成元素的非凡协调。但是，迪尔凯姆观察到，像斯宾塞这样的机械论者，将两者都解释为有效因素的确定性结果，而不是最终因素。斯宾塞认为，有机体与其环境之间的和谐可以用“适应性”和“同质性的不稳定性”来解释，也就是说，同质性的物质本质上是不稳定的，因此有机体必须分化以适应其环境。部件之间的内部协调可以用“分离”来解释，也就是把相似的东西连接起来形成不同的系统。迪尔凯姆对斯宾塞的答复重申了他早先对最终目标的承诺。例如，如果一个生物体被放置在一个不友好的环境中，它可能会或可能不会发育出适应它所需的器官。但是，如果它确实发展了这些适应性器官，涂尔干认为，这种发展可以简单地解释为器官是必要的这一事实的结果吗？如果是这样的话，这不就是最终性原则的证明吗？如果不是，这种发展难道不是偶然的结果吗？此外，斯宾塞的理论可能解释了有机体各部分的物理协调(即，相似元素的重组) ，但它无法解释它们的有机协调 ± ，即，它们的系统化或从属于一个主要的统一体。在有机体中，迪尔凯姆提醒他的学生，所有的部分在整体上合作，这种从属在每个单独的器官中重复。简而言之，有机体与其环境之间的和谐以及有机体内部组成元素的协调，使我们对自然原因的诉求更加必要(1884:542)。

If the evidence of harmony and equilibrium in nature is thus suf®cient to justify the belief in a ®nal cause, how was this cause to be represented? The physico-theological argument, Durkheim reminded his students, conceives of the world as a work of art, and attributes its finality to the intelligence of an artist; in short, it conceives of the world anthropomorphically, as the product of a transcendent mind. But why can’t ®nality be immanent ± i.e., things going spontaneously to their end, as if guided by instinct rather than a transcendent mind? Versions of such an argument appear in Aristotle and also in Hegel; but it was immediately clear that here Durkheim was referring to Hartmann and Schopenhauer, whose theory of immanent ®nality was designed to replace transcendent finality and avoid anthropomorphism altogether. The “great failure” of their argument, according to Durkheim, was that it is irrepresentible. Briefly, all finality assumes the concept of an end; and such a concept is a psychological phenomenon, and is thus inconceivable without consciousness. Because he embraced the doctrine of unconscious psychological phenomena, Hartmann was undisturbed by this objection; but Durkheim, as we have seen, had already rejected the notion of the unconscious, and was thus led to accept a transcendent finality.

如果自然界的和谐与平衡的证据足以证明人们相信一个原因，那么这个原因应该如何表达呢？迪尔凯姆提醒他的学生们，物理神学的论点认为世界是一件艺术品，并把它的终结归因于艺术家的智慧; 简而言之，它认为世界是拟人化的，是超验思维的产物。但是，为什么天性不能是内在的，也就是说，事物自发地走向它们的终点，就好像是由本能而不是一个超然的头脑引导的？亚里士多德和黑格尔都有类似的观点，但很明显迪尔凯姆指的是哈特曼和叔本华，他们的内在性理论旨在取代先验的终结性，完全避免拟人论。根据涂尔干的说法，他们论点的“大失败”在于它是无法代表的。简而言之，所有的结局都假定终点的概念，而这样的概念是一种心理现象，因此没有意识是不可想象的。因为他接受了无意识心理现象的学说，哈特曼对这种反对并不感到不安; 但是，正如我们所看到的，涂尔干已经拒绝了无意识的概念，因此被引导去接受一个超验的结局。

Does the physico-theological argument prove the existence of God? Kant thought not, addressing two objections to the argument, and Durkheim agreed with him on both. First, while the physico-theological argument demonstrates clearly that there is an “architect” of the universe, and that its form is contingent, it does not demonstrate that there is a “creator,” and that the material is contingent. For this, we require the cosmological argument, which Kant had also rejected. Second, while the physico-theological argument begins with experience, it is not limited to experience alone. For if the order and harmony of the world are imperfect, we cannot conclude with the existence of a perfect cause. In fact, everything given to us in experience is more or less imperfect, and thus the physico-theological argument yields at best a cause which is “very wise” and “very powerful” in relation to ourselves - but is not a perfect cause.

物理神学论证证明了上帝的存在吗？康德不这么认为，他提出了两个反对意见，涂尔干在这两个问题上都同意他的观点。首先，虽然物理神学论证清楚地证明了宇宙有一个“建筑师”，而且宇宙的形式是偶然的，但它并没有证明存在一个“创造者”，也没有证明物质是偶然的。为此，我们需要的宇宙论证，康德也拒绝了。其次，虽然物理神学的论证始于经验，但它并不局限于经验本身。因为如果世界的秩序与和谐是不完美的，我们就不能得出一个完美原因存在的结论。事实上，在经验中给予我们的一切或多或少都是不完美的，因此物理-神学的论点最多只能产生一个与我们自身相关的“非常明智”和“非常强大”的原因——但并不是一个完美的原因。

This brought Durkheim to the moral arguments for the existence of God. The first moral proof is from common consent — i.e., the notion, initially advanced by Cicero, that because all men believe in God, God must exist. But as Durkheim immediately pointed out, it isn't clear that all men believe in God, and even if they did, this would provide only a presumption — not a proof — in favor of God's existence. The second moral argument, of course, was Kant’s — i.e., that two elements of morality seem to presume a foundation outside of morality itself. The first element is obligation — i.e., the moral law must bind us in some way, and it can do so only if we consider it as something living — i.e., as God himself; and the second element is the sanction — i.e., reason cries out for the harmony of virtue and happiness, and this is possible only assuming a transcendent God who puts nature into conformity with morality. So God appears to us both as the living moral law and as the sole condition on which the harmony of happiness and virtue might be realized. From the metaphysical arguments, therefore, Durkheim was able to conclude that God exists as an absolute end, and also that he is the architect — but not necessarily creator ± of the world; and from the moral arguments Durkheim was able to conclude that God is the living moral law, as well as the condition of moral sanctions.

这就把涂尔干引向了上帝存在的道德论证。第一个道德证明来自于共识ーー即西塞罗最初提出的观念，即因为所有人都信仰上帝，所以上帝必须存在。但正如涂尔干立即指出的那样，并不清楚是否所有的人都相信上帝，即使他们相信，这也只能提供支持上帝存在的假设，而不是证据。当然，第二个道德论点是康德的ーー也就是说，道德的两个要素似乎假定了道德本身之外的一个基础。第一个要素是义务ーー也就是说，道德法则必须以某种方式约束我们，而且只有当我们认为它是有生命的东西ーー也就是上帝本身时，它才能做到这一点; 第二个要素是约束ーー也就是说，理性呼唤美德与幸福的和谐，而这只有在假设一个超然的上帝使自然与道德相一致的情况下才有可能。因此，在我们看来，上帝既是活着的道德法则，又是实现幸福与美德和谐的唯一条件。因此，从形而上学的论证中，涂尔干得出结论，上帝作为一个绝对的目的存在，而且他是世界的建筑师ーー但不一定是创造者 ± ; 从道德论证中，涂尔干得出结论，上帝是活着的道德法则，也是道德制裁的条件。

How does God relate to the world? Writers like Descartes had insisted that the world must be perpetually connected to the source from which it takes its existence ± his primary metaphysical argument for the existence of providence. But here, Durkheim observed, it is useful to introduce the traditional distinction between a particular and a general providence. The first, as described by Bossuet, is an effective intervention of God in the human events of the world; but this doctrine of a particular providence, Durkheim complained, both contradicts the idea of human freedom and exalts the power of God at the expense of his dignity. Providence is therefore general ± i.e., it is the perfect wisdom and goodness of God, exercised at the beginning of time when it established the laws that govern the world, and continuing into the present through the maintenance of these laws and the conservation of the world.

上帝与这个世界有什么关系？像笛卡尔这样的作家坚持认为，世界必须永远与其存在的源头相连接 ± 他对上帝存在的主要形而上学论证。但在这里，涂尔干观察到，介绍一个特定的和一般的天意之间的传统区别是有用的。第一个，正如博须埃所描述的，是上帝对世界上人类事件的有效干预; 但是涂尔干抱怨说，这种特殊的天意学说既违背了人类自由的理念，又以牺牲上帝的尊严为代价来颂扬上帝的力量。因此，天意是普遍的，也就是说，它是上帝完美的智慧和善良，在它建立统治世界的法律之初就得到运用，并通过维护这些法律和保护世界而延续到现在。

A serious objection to this notion of a general providence, however, had been made by Pierre Bayle (1647—1706), who had revived the Manichaean doctrine of evil as a principle independent of God. Evil, Bayle had observed, may be of three kinds: metaphysical (the physical and intellectual imperfection of all beings, including ourselves); moral (the weakness of our will, which leads to sin); and physical (suffering, illness, and death). How can such evil, Bayle asked, be reconciled with our notion of a general providence? In his Theodicy (1710), Leibniz responded to Bayle that none of these evils proves anything against providence, for each is but the condition of inestimable goods, which would be impossible without them. Metaphysical evil, for example, simply shows that, as created beings, we cannot be perfect — something that belongs to the absolute alone. Far from being an independent entity, therefore, this kind of evil is only the negation — and thus a condition — of the good. Similarly, moral evil is a necessary condition of moral good, for we can do good (or evil) only if we are free to choose. Finally, physical evil is the consequence of the operations of natural laws; but these laws were not created for that reason, but because without them the world would not exist. The suffering of some individuals is thus a condition of the existence of the world. Moreover, pain and suffering are “the best school of morality,” raising individuals to a kind of dignity that the perpetually happy person could never achieve. At the moment of creation, Leibniz argued, God imagined the in®nity of possible universes, and chose ± not the absolutely best ± but the best possible world. So to judge the perfection of the creation ± and thus the goodness of its author ± we must resist the tendency to judge each of the parts in detail, and instead judge the totality of things that exist. Evil can be considered bad only by minds that systematically limit their analysis to a part rather than the whole; and while the whole world is not perfect, neither is it bad. It is, according the Leibniz, the best of all possible worlds.

然而，皮埃尔 · 贝勒(Pierre Bayle，1647-1706)对这种普遍天意的概念提出了严重的反对意见，他恢复了摩尼教的邪恶教义，将其作为独立于上帝的原则。贝尔观察到，邪恶可能有三种: 形而上学的(包括我们自己在内的所有生物在身体和智力上的不完美) ; 道德的(我们意志的弱点，导致罪恶) ; 和身体的(痛苦，疾病和死亡)。贝尔问道，这样的罪恶怎么能与我们普遍的天意的概念相协调呢？在他的 Theodicy (1710)中，莱布尼茨回应贝尔说，这些罪恶都不能证明任何违背天意的东西，因为每一个都只是不可估量的财富的状态，没有它们就不可能实现。例如，形而上学的邪恶只是表明，作为被创造的存在，我们不可能是完美的ーー某些属于绝对独立的东西。因此，这种邪恶远远不是一个独立的实体，而只是对善的否定ーー因而是一种条件。同样，道德的邪恶是道德良好的必要条件，因为我们只有在自由选择的情况下才能做好事(或做恶事)。最后，物质上的邪恶是自然法则运作的结果; 但是这些法则并不是因为这个原因而创造出来的，而是因为没有它们，世界就不会存在。因此，一些个人的痛苦是世界存在的一个条件。此外，痛苦和苦难是“最好的道德学校”，将个人提升到一种永远快乐的人永远无法实现的尊严。莱布尼茨认为，在创世的那一刻，上帝想象了可能存在的宇宙的一体性，并且选择了最可能存在的世界，而不是绝对最好的世界。因此，要判断创作的完美性，从而判断作者的善良，我们必须抵制这样的倾向，即判断每个部分的细节，而是判断存在的事物的总体性。只有那些系统地将分析局限于部分而非整体的思想才能认为邪恶; 尽管整个世界不是完美的，但它也不是邪恶的。莱布尼茨认为，这是所有可能世界中最好的一个。

If Durkheim thus agreed with Leibniz’s response to Bayle’s theological pessimism, his real concern was to counter the psychological and moral pessimism of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, whose works he found to be “almost popular over large parts of Europe’’ (1884: 564±5). This is important, because S. G. Mestrovic has recently advanced the argument that Schopenhauer was a powerful influence on Durkheim’s work (1988a; 1988b). The evidence of the Sens lectures, however, suggests otherwise. Schopenhauer’s pessimism, Durkheim explained to his students, makes pleasure only the negation of pain, and thus makes pain the positive, normal fact of our sensibility; and while Hartmann at least granted pleasure a positive value, he also insisted that the quantity of pleasure that one can experience in life is vastly inferior to the amount of pain we are assured. If Hartmann is right, Durkheim acknowledged, then the being that created us does not merit the name of “providence”; and in fact, Hartmann insisted that the Unconscious ± i.e., the mysterious principle of all nature ± created us only to realize its own, personal ends. But Durkheim insisted that Schopenhauer and Hartmann were wrong, for two reasons. First, the pessimists treat pleasure as an objective, impersonal phenomenon; but pleasure, Durkheim insisted, is clearly an individual matter ± i.e., what is “pleasurable” for one person might not be pleasurable for the next ± and thus they can hardly be submitted to quantitative measurement. Second, the pessimists assume that pain obsesses the mind for long periods, while pleasure is fleeting; but memory and hope, Durkheim argued, allow us to make pleasures endure no less than pains. Aristotle’s Ethics tells us that happiness is an art, Durkheim concluded his last lecture ± and an art can be learned.

如果迪尔凯姆因此同意莱布尼茨对贝尔的神学悲观主义的回应，他真正关心的是反对叔本华和哈特曼的心理和道德悲观主义，他发现叔本华和哈特曼的作品“几乎在欧洲大部分地区流行”(1884:564 ± 5)。这一点很重要，因为 S · G · 梅斯特罗维奇最近提出了叔本华对涂尔干作品(1988a; 1988b)有强大影响的论点。然而，森斯讲座的证据表明，情况并非如此。涂尔干向他的学生解释说，叔本华的悲观主义使得快乐只是对痛苦的否定，因此使得痛苦成为我们感性的积极的、正常的事实; 尽管哈特曼至少赋予了快乐一个积极的价值，但他也坚持认为，一个人在生活中能够体验到的快乐的数量远远低于我们所确信的痛苦的数量。迪尔凯姆承认，如果哈特曼是正确的，那么创造我们的存在就不应该被称为“天意”; 事实上，哈特曼坚持认为无意识，也就是所有自然界的神秘原则创造了我们，只是为了实现它自己的个人目的。但涂尔干坚持认为叔本华和哈特曼是错误的，原因有二。首先，悲观主义者认为快乐是一种客观的、非个人化的现象; 但是迪尔凯姆坚持认为，快乐显然是一个个体的事情，也就是说，对一个人来说“快乐”的事情可能对下一个人来说不是快乐的事情，因此他们很难接受定量的测量。其次，悲观主义者认为痛苦会长时间困扰我们的大脑，而快乐是转瞬即逝的; 但是迪尔凯姆认为，记忆和希望让我们能够让快乐不亚于痛苦。亚里士多德的伦理学告诉我们，快乐是一门艺术，涂尔干结束了他的最后一堂课，一门艺术是可以学习的。

BOUTROUX, FUSTEL, AND RENQUVIER

BOUTROUX FUSTEL 和 RENQUIER

The Sens lectures, of course, were not intended for publication, and thus they provide few indications of the writers from whom Durkheim drew these early ideas. A good place to start looking, however, is among Durkheim's mentors at the Ecole Normale Superieure. One of the most important of these was the neo-Kantian philosopher Emile Boutroux (1845-1921). During his studies at the Ecole Normale Superieure from 1865 to 1868, Boutroux had come under the influence of the neo-spiritualist philosopher Jules Lachelier (1832-1918), whose Du fondement de l'induction (1871) had challenged the foundations of rationalism and determinism on Kantian grounds (Potts and Charlton 1974: 71). Boutroux’s first major work was De la contingence des lois de la nature, a study of determinism in its relation to the physical and moral sciences, for which he received his doctorate in 1874 and which ultimately proved to be his magnum opus. After teaching at Montpellier and Nancy, in 1877 Boutroux received an appointment in philosophy at the Ecole Normale, where he remained for the next nine years - including the period from 1879 to 1882, when Durkheim was his student.

当然，森斯的讲座并不打算出版，因此它们很少提供关于迪尔凯姆从哪些作家那里得到这些早期思想的线索。然而，从迪尔凯姆的导师们那里开始寻找高等师范学校是个不错的选择。其中最重要的是新康德主义哲学家埃米尔 · 布特鲁克斯(1845-1921)。在1865年至1868年的高等师范学校学习期间，布特鲁克斯受到了新唯灵主义哲学家朱尔斯 · 拉切利埃(Jules Lachelier，1832-1918)的影响，拉切利埃在1871年对康德的理性主义和决定论的基础提出了挑战(波茨和查尔顿1974:71)。布特鲁克斯的第一部主要著作是《自然法的偶然性》 ，这是一部研究决定论与物理和道德科学之间关系的著作，1874年他因此获得了博士学位，并最终被证明是他的代表作。在蒙彼利埃和南希教书后，布特鲁克斯于1877年在 Ecole Normale 接受了哲学方面的任命，并在那里呆了9年——包括从1879年到1882年这段时间，当时涂尔干还是他的学生。

In discussing his undeniable influence on Durkheim, it is customary to focus on Boutroux’s insistence on the distinctiveness and irreducibility of the various sciences; but as W. W. Miller has recently emphasized - and as the title itself implies - De la contingence is primarily about causality itself, and the issue of necessity versus contingency (1996: 61). “If [the laws of nature] were actually necessary,’’ Boutroux wrote in the preface, “[they] would signify the immutability and rigidity of death. If they are contingent, they dignify life and constitute points of support or bases which enable us constantly to rise towards a higher life’’ (1916: vii). Boutroux’s goal was thus to show that the laws of nature are contingent rather than necessary, and that they indeed make a “higher life’’ possible. Boutroux did not deny that the principle of causality could be stated in such a form that it would be necessarily true; but he did insist that this is not the sense in which the principle is actually used in the natural sciences. On the contrary, for the purposes of scientific practice, the more Humean, empiricist notion of “relatively invariable relations’’ between the phenomena is all that is required for the formulation of scientific laws. The idea of necessity is simply not required. The principle of causality is derived from experience, as “a very general and abstract expression of observed relations” (1916: 23-5). So the development of the sciences themselves suggests that the laws of nature do not express objectively necessary relations. Scientific laws are useful, but they are not definitive. “There is no equivalence,” Boutroux thus insisted, “no relation of causality, pure and simple, between a man and the elements that gave him birth, between the developed being and the being in process of formation” (1916: 32).

在讨论他对涂尔干不可否认的影响时，人们习惯性地关注布特鲁克斯对各种科学的独特性和不可还原性的坚持; 但正如 W · W · 米勒最近所强调的——正如标题本身所暗示的——德拉偶然性主要是关于因果关系本身，以及必然性与偶然性的问题(1996:61)。“如果[自然法则]真的是必要的,”布特鲁克斯在序言中写道，“[它们]将意味着死亡的不变性和刚性。”。如果他们是偶然的，他们尊重生命，构成支持点或基础，使我们不断上升到更高的生活”(1916年: 七)。布特鲁克斯的目标就是要证明自然法则是偶然的，而不是必然的，它们确实使“更高的生活”成为可能。布特鲁克斯并不否认因果关系原则可以以这样一种形式陈述，即它必然是正确的; 但他确实坚持认为，这不是该原则在自然科学中实际使用的意义。相反，为了科学实践的目的，更休谟的，经验主义的现象之间的“相对不变的关系”的概念是所有需要的科学规律的制定。必然性的概念根本就不需要。因果关系的原则来源于经验，作为“观察关系的一个非常普遍和抽象的表达”(1916:23-5)。因此，科学本身的发展表明，自然规律并不表达客观必然的关系。科学定律是有用的，但它们不是决定性的。布特鲁克斯因此坚持认为: “在一个人与其诞生的元素之间，在发达的存在与形成过程中的存在之间，没有纯粹和简单的因果关系”(1916:32)。

In opposition to the rationalist conception of a single world comprised of logically deducible necessary relations, therefore, Boutroux insisted on “several worlds, forming, as it were, stages superposed on one another” (1916: 151-2). These include the world of pure necessity (i.e., of quantity without quality), the world of causes, the world of notions, the mathematical world, the physical world, the living world and, at last, the thinking world. At first, Boutroux acknowledged, each of these worlds seems to depend on those beneath it, and to receive from them its existence and its laws; but again, the examination and comparison of these forms of being, as well as the sciences that study them, show that it is impossible to connect the higher to the lower forms by any link of necessity. This means, in turn, that the universe is not made up of equal elements capable of being transformed into one another like algebraic quantities; on the contrary, each world contains something new, something more than the worlds below, so that within each world the amount of being and the degree of perfection is indeterminate (1916: 158—9). Each world, in short, is indeterminate and contingent — i.e., might not have existed, or might have existed in some other form — rather than logically or causally necessary.

因此，布特鲁克斯反对由逻辑上可演绎的必要关系组成的单一世界的理性主义概念，坚持“几个世界，形成，可以说，阶段相互叠加”(1916:151-2)。这些世界包括纯粹必然的世界(即，数量而非质量的世界) ，原因的世界，观念的世界，数学的世界，物理的世界，生活的世界，最后是思考的世界。起初，布特鲁克斯承认，这些世界似乎都依赖于它下面的世界，并从它们那里获得它的存在和它的法则; 但是，对这些存在形式以及研究它们的科学的检验和比较表明，不可能通过任何必然性的联系将高级形式与低级形式联系起来。这意味着，反过来，宇宙并不是由相同的元素组成的，这些元素可以像代数量一样相互转化; 相反，每个世界都包含一些新的东西，一些比下面的世界更多的东西，因此在每个世界里，存在的数量和完美的程度是不确定的(1916:158ー9)。简而言之，每个世界都是不确定和偶然的ーー也就是说，可能不存在，或者可能以其他形式存在ーー而不是逻辑上或因果上必要的。

Clearly, this was a view that had obvious consequences for Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. “The creation of man, a conscious being,’’ Boutroux made clear, “cannot be explained simply by the operation of the physical and physiological laws. His existence and action impose on nature modifications which she herself cannot understand, and which appear as contingent, if we adopt the standpoint of the physical and physiological worlds’’ (1916: 127). And as this passage implies, Boutroux — a devout Roman Catholic — considered God the creator of both the existence and the essence of all beings. From the religious standpoint, therefore, the doctrine of contingency was quite literally a theory of divine providence (1916: 180).

显然，这一观点对达尔文的自然选择进化论有着明显的影响。“人的创造，一个有意识的存在,”布特鲁克斯明确表示，“不能简单地用物理和生理规律的运作来解释。他的存在和行动强加于她自己无法理解的自然改变，如果我们采取物理和生理世界的观点，这些改变看起来是偶然的”(1916:127)。正如这段话所暗示的，布特鲁克斯ーー一个虔诚的罗马天主教徒ーー认为上帝创造了万物的存在和本质。因此，从宗教的观点来看，偶然性的学说是一个相当字面上的神圣眷顾理论(1916:180)。

What is the effect of this doctrine of contingency on the positive sciences? Those “static” sciences based on the principle of the conservation of being (e.g., mathematics, physics, etc.), Boutroux admitted, are reduced to an abstract value, for these have no other role than to deduce consequences from stated conditions, under the hypothesis that these conditions must be exactly determined and the quantity of being not varied. But on the “dynamic” sciences (e.g., biology, psychology, sociology, etc.), the doctrine of contingency imposes only the condition that science become genuinely empiricist rather than rationalist in orientation. Observation and experiment become “the indispensable method of the dynamic sciences,” the “eternal source and rule of science, in so far as this latter would know things in truly objective fashion, i.e., in their history as well as in their nature, which, after all, is but one of their states” (1916: 165—6). So the doctrine of contingency condemns only the rationalist claim that science might dispense with experience: “we cannot have the reduction of the historic to the static sciences,'' Boutroux insisted. On the contrary, “the former become the truly concrete sciences, whereas the rest, in various degrees, are but abstract sciences” (1916: 167).

这种偶然性学说对实证科学有什么影响？布特鲁克斯承认，那些基于存在守恒原理的“静态”科学(例如，数学、物理等)被归结为一个抽象的价值，因为这些科学除了从规定的条件中推断结果之外，没有其他作用，假设这些条件必须被精确地确定，而且数量不能变化。但是对于“动态”科学(例如生物学、心理学、社会学等等) ，偶然性学说只强加了科学成为真正的经验主义而不是取向上的理性主义的条件。观察和实验成为“动态科学不可或缺的方法”，“科学的永恒源泉和规则，只要后者以真正客观的方式知道事物，即在其历史和性质，毕竟，这只是其状态之一”(1916:165ー6)。因此，偶然性学说只谴责理性主义者关于科学可以省略经验的主张: “我们不能把历史还原为静态科学,”布特鲁克斯坚持说。相反，“前者成为真正具体的科学，而其余的，在不同程度上，只是抽象的科学”(1916:167)。

Descartes, of course, had simply dismissed history and the “human sciences” as being of no interest to genuine seekers after truth, for they were incapable of yielding either precise dehnitions or the clear rules of evidence from which irrefutable conclusions could be drawn by logical deduction.[57](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark68) By contrast, Boutroux’s doctrine of contingency suddenly made history “singularly important.’’ The history of things was no longer the logical, necessary development of their intrinsic nature. On the contrary, things might have been otherwise, or not at all, and thus the conditions of their development up to their present, contingent state became a matter of serious empirical investigation (1916: 166—7). An obvious corollary of this contingency and indeterminacy is freedom of individual thought and action. The individual, Boutroux thus insisted, “is not only the creator of his character, he can also intervene in the events of his life and change their course; every moment he can strengthen his acquired tendencies or endeavor to modify them’’ (1916: 172). Forty years after De la contingence, Boutroux could thus write: “I have restored to man, qua man, his thoughts and feelings, his will and action, that reality and affective influence over the course of things which common sense attributes to them . . . Man is able to act on nature because nature itself is neither a brute force nor a lifeless thought, but rather a veritable being, which, even now, in its own way, tends to exist and develop, to create and transcend itself” (1916: vi—vii).

当然，笛卡尔只是简单地将历史和“人文科学”视为对真正的真理追求者没有兴趣，因为他们既不能产生精确的否定，也不能产生明确的证据规则，从中可以通过逻辑推理得出无可辩驳的结论。57相比之下，布特鲁克斯的偶然性学说突然使历史变得“异常重要”事物的历史不再是其内在本质的逻辑的、必然的发展。相反，事情可能已经不同，或根本没有，因此，他们的发展条件到目前为止，或有状态成为一个严肃的实证研究的问题(1916:166ー7)。这种偶然性和不确定性的一个显而易见的必然结果是个人思想和行动的自由。布特鲁克斯因此坚持认为，个体“不仅是他性格的创造者，他还可以介入他生活中的事件并改变它们的进程; 每一刻他都可以加强他后天习得的倾向或努力改变它们”(1916:172)。在德拉偶然事件发生40年后，布特鲁克斯可以这样写道: “我恢复了人类，作为人类，他的思想和感情，他的意志和行动，以及常识赋予他们的现实和情感对事物进程的影响... ... 人之所以能够对自然采取行动，是因为自然本身既不是一种残暴的力量，也不是一种无生命的思想，而是一种名副其实的存在，即使是现在，它也倾向于以自己的方式存在和发展，创造和超越自身。”(1916年: vi ー vii)。

The significance of De la contingence to the development of Durkheim’s sociology is well known. In 1907, responding to Simon Deploige’s “accusation” that the distinction he had drawn between psychology and sociology had been borrowed from Wilhelm Wundt (1832 — 1920), Durkheim at first acknowledged that “in Wundt, there is a tendency in this direction, intermingled in other places with contrary tendencies.” But Durkheim went on to insist that he had acquired the idea elsewhere:

德拉偶然性对涂尔干社会学发展的意义是众所周知的。1907年，迪尔凯姆回应西蒙 · 德普洛伊奇的“指责”，即他所划分的心理学和社会学之间的区别是借鉴自威廉 · 冯特(1832-1920) ，他首先承认“在 Wundt，存在着这个方向的趋势，与其他地方的相反趋势混杂在一起。”但迪尔凯姆继续坚称，他是从别处获得这个想法的:

I owe it first to my master, Boutroux, who, at the Ecole normale superieure, repeated frequently to us that each science must, as Aristotle says, explain [its own phenomena] by “its own principles” — e.g., psychology by psychological principles, biology by biological principles. Most impressed by this idea, I applied it to sociology. I was con®rmed in this method by the reading of Comte, since for him, sociology is irreducible to biology (and consequently to psychology), just as biology is irreducible to the physicochemical sciences. When I read Wundt’s Ethik, I had already been moving in this direction for some time. (1907: 612 — 13)

我首先要感谢我的导师布特鲁克斯，他在高等师范学校上经常向我们重复，每一门科学都必须像亚里士多德所说的那样，用“它自己的原理”来解释[它自己的现象]ーー例如，用心理学原理来解释心理学，用生物学原理来解释生物学。对这个想法印象最深刻的是，我把它应用到了社会学上。读了孔德的著作后，我对这种方法产生了共鸣，因为对他来说，社会学不能还原为生物学(因此也不能还原为心理学) ，就像生物学不能还原为物理化学科学一样。当我读冯特的《思想》时，我已经朝着这个方向前进了一段时间。(1907:612ー13)

In De la contingence, of course, this idea was combined with an insistence on the contingency (by contrast with necessity) of the laws of nature, opposition to determinism and af®rmation of free will, denial that the evolution of the human mind could be explained by natural selection, a preference for empiricism rather than rationalism, an anti-Cartesian emphasis on the importance of history, a teleological notion of human perfection as the goal of life — all reflected in the Sens lectures.

当然，在《德拉偶然》中，这个观点与坚持自然法则的偶然性(与必然性相对)相结合，反对决定论和自由意志的形成，否认人类思想的进化可以用自然选择来解释，偏爱经验主义而不是理性主义，反笛卡尔主义强调历史的重要性，目的论的人类完美作为人生目标的观点——这些都反映在森斯的讲座中。

But if Boutroux’s influence on Durkheim is not deniable, neither is it unambiguous. Durkheim’s later, extremely ambitious claims for sociology, for example, went far beyond anything that Boutroux could condone. In his inaugural lecture at Bordeaux (1887), Durkheim insisted that “all natural entities from the mineral world up through man come within the province of positive science, that is to say that all that concerns them occurs according to necessary laws. This proposition no longer partakes of conjecture; it is a truth which experience has demonstrated, for these laws have been found, or at least we are discovering them little by little'' (1978a: 47). The obvious, Boutrouxian objection ± i.e., that the notion of necessary laws of human behavior contradicts that of free will — “can hardly interest us,'' Durkheim insisted, “and we can ignore it, not out of disdain, but through the application of method.'' One must choose: “Either one recognizes that social phenomena are accessible to scientihc investigation,” Durkheim insisted, “or else one admits, for no reason and contrary to all the inductions of science, that there are two worlds within the world: one in which reigns the law of causality, the other in which reign arbitrariness and contingency” (1978a: 48).

但如果说布特鲁克斯对涂尔干的影响是不可否认的，那么这种影响也是不容置疑的。例如，迪尔凯姆后来极其雄心勃勃的社会学主张，远远超出了布特鲁克斯所能容忍的范围。在他1887年在波尔多的开幕演讲中，涂尔干坚持认为“从矿物世界到人类的所有自然实体都属于实证科学的范畴，也就是说，所有与它们有关的事情都是根据必然的规律发生的。这个命题不再是猜测，而是经验已经证明的真理，因为这些规律已经被发现，或者至少我们正在一点一点地发现它们”(1978a: 47)。显而易见的是，布特鲁克斯的反对意见，即人类行为的必然规律的概念与自由意志的概念相矛盾ーー涂尔干坚持认为，“我们几乎不会对此感兴趣，我们可以忽略它，不是出于鄙视，而是通过运用方法。”人们必须做出选择: “要么认识到社会现象是可以通过科学研究得到的,”迪尔凯姆坚持说，“要么承认，世界上有两个世界: 一个统治因果律，另一个统治任意性和偶然性。”(1978a: 48)。

Boutroux, of course, would have resisted such a conclusion; but De la contingence contains no explicit discussion of “laws of social behavior.'' Boutroux's theory of qualitatively different, irreducible levels of being culminated with the “thinking world'' of human selfconsciousness — not human societies. In 1892—93, however, Boutroux gave a series of lectures at the Sorbonne, subsequently published under the title De I'idee de loi naturelle dans la science et la philosophie contemporaines (1895), in which the status of sociological laws was treated in much greater detail (Boutroux 1914). Where the philosophic quest to ®nd laws that are both “universal” and “real” had failed, Boutroux began, science has succeeded by effecting a compromise between the ideal of mathematics and the reality of experience. Science has achieved this by trying to ®nd “an appropriate positive principle for each order of realities,'' eventually producing laws that are both concrete and intelligible. “The sciences have thus been emancipated, one after the other,'' Boutroux repeated the argument of De la contingence, and “have been set up as autonomous, with the aid of special principles regarded as irreducible'' (1914: 18—19). To truly understand the idea of natural law, therefore, we should begin with science, appealing to philosophy only for the interpretation of the result. Boutroux thus took each group of laws — e.g., logical, mathematical, mechanical, physical, chemical, biological, psychological, and sociological — “just as the sciences offer them,'' only then asking the important philosophical questions (1914: 19—21).

布特鲁克斯当然会反对这样的结论; 但是德拉偶然性并没有包含对“社会行为规律”的明确讨论布特鲁克斯关于不同的、不可简化的人类自我意识的“思维世界”(而不是人类社会)达到顶峰的理论。然而，在1892ー93年，布特鲁克斯在 Sorbonne 举办了一系列讲座，随后以《当代科学与哲学中的自然法》(1895年)为题发表，其中对社会学法律的地位进行了更为详细的论述(布特鲁克斯1914年)。布特鲁克斯首先指出，当哲学追求“普遍”和“真实”的规律失败时，科学通过在数学的理想和经验的现实之间达成妥协而取得了成功。科学已经通过尝试和“一个适当的积极的原则为每一个现实秩序,”最终产生的法律是具体的和可理解的。布特鲁克斯重复了德拉偶然性的论点，并且“在被认为是不可还原的特殊原则的帮助下，已经被建立为自治的”(1914:18-19)。因此，要真正理解自然法的概念，我们应该从科学入手，诉诸哲学只是为了解释结果。因此，布特鲁克斯把每一组法则ーー例如逻辑、数学、机械、物理、化学、生物、心理和社会学ーー“就像科学所提供的那样”，然后才提出重要的哲学问题(1914:19ー21)。

When Boutroux turned his attention to the possibility of establishing scienti®c laws in the realm of society and politics, his approach was again deeply historical; and again, it emphasized the role of contingency. In the teleological world of Greek antiquity, he observed, nature is the artist, and the polis is nature's ideal societal expression. In the 17th and 18th centuries, by contrast, Hobbes, Montesquieu, and Rousseau conceive of society as a work of art rather than a work of nature ± i.e., as the arti®cial product of human reason. But from the 18th century on, writers like Condorcet, Comte, and Spencer have advanced the notion that society is a product of nature, not of art.[58](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark69) “What is the notion of sociological law,'' Boutroux asked, “which results from this historical evolution from antiquity to the present? Does this notion correspond with the nature of the things themselves?” (1914: 194).

当布特鲁克斯将注意力转向在社会和政治领域建立科学法律的可能性时，他的方法再次深入到历史层面，并再次强调偶然性的作用。在希腊古代的目的论世界中，他观察到，自然是艺术家，城邦是自然的理想社会表达。相比之下，在17和18世纪，霍布斯、孟德斯鸠和卢梭把社会看作是一件艺术品，而不是一件自然的作品，也就是说，是人类理性的人工产品。但是从18世纪开始，像 Condorcet、孔德和斯宾塞这样的作家就提出了社会是自然的产物，而不是第58条的观点。“什么是社会学规律的概念,”布特鲁克斯问道，“它是从古代到现在的历史演变的结果？这个概念是否符合事物本身的性质?”(1914:194).

Boutroux's answer to these questions ®rst noted that such a conception of sociological laws eliminates a strictly human faculty, i.e., conscious, reflective, purposeful action: “To explain phenomena, it is declared, is to condition them to the law of ef®cient causes. If sociology, then, would be a science like the rest, it must connect facts with conditions, not with ends.''[59](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark70) But even if sociology thus limits itself to efficient causes, Boutroux asked, why should it be modeled on the natural sciences? The whole point of Boutroux's historical survey of sociological thought was to show that such models are historically contingent, not logically necessary. In the 17th and 18th centuries, for example, the mathematical sciences were preeminent, and it was assumed that sociological laws should take on a mathematical form. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the natural sciences have achieved greater status, so we assume that these should now be our models. But why, Boutroux again asked, should not sociology demand particular postulates and a method of its own?

布特鲁克斯对这些问题的回答首先指出，这种社会学规律的概念消除了严格意义上的人的能力，即，有意识的，反思的，有目的的行动: “解释现象，它被宣布，是条件他们的有效原因的规律。如果社会学和其他科学一样，那么它必须将事实与条件联系起来，而不是与目的联系起来。布特鲁克斯问道: “但是，即使社会学将自身局限于有效的原因，为什么它要模仿自然科学呢？布特鲁克斯对社会学思想的历史考察的全部意义在于表明，这种模式是历史偶然的，没有逻辑上的必要性。例如，在17和18世纪，数学科学是卓越的，人们认为社会学规律应该采取一种数学形式。在19世纪和20世纪，自然科学获得了更高的地位，所以我们认为这些现在应该是我们的模型。但是，布特鲁克斯再次问道，为什么社会学不应该要求特定的假设和自己的方法呢？

As we saw in his writings on education, Durkheim would ask himself the same question; but Boutroux's answer was quite different. First, he insisted that sociological laws are like historical laws, for, at least in theory, historians connect the present to the past by means of efficient causes. But such laws, Boutroux observed, are not necessary laws ± i.e., “the antecedent is never considered as necessarily compelled to entail any one consequent to the exclusion of any other. An antecedent is regarded as an influence, not as a cause strictly so-called” (1914: 196). More fundamentally, however, Bou-troux joined his former colleague at the Ecole Normale, Fustel, in questioning whether historians ever discover “laws” at all. A law, Fustel had observed, “implies the reappearance of one and the same antecedent.” But historical facts “are too complex and unstable intermixtures to be reproduced as they are. If they exhibit laws,” Boutroux concluded, “it is in their elements, not in their concrete sequence, that we must seek them” (1914: 197).

正如我们在他关于教育的著作中所看到的，涂尔干也会问自己同样的问题，但布特鲁克斯的回答却截然不同。首先，他坚持认为，社会学规律就像历史规律，至少在理论上，历史学家通过有效的原因将现在与过去联系起来。但是，布特鲁克斯观察到，这样的定律并不是必然的定律，也就是说，“前件从来不被认为是必然地被迫引起任何一个结果而排除任何其他结果。前因被认为是一种影响，而不是严格意义上所谓的“原因”(1914:196)。然而，更根本的是，布-特鲁克斯与他在 Fustel 师范学院的前同事一道，质疑历史学家是否真的发现了“规律”。法则，福斯特观察到，“意味着同一个先例的重现。”但历史事实“太过复杂和不稳定的混合物，不可能像现在这样复制。布特鲁克斯总结道: “如果他们展示了法则，那么我们就必须在他们的要素中寻找法则，而不是在他们的具体顺序中寻找法则”(1914:197)。

Boutroux thus turned to a second alternative - i.e., that we try to connect social facts, not with their equally social antecedents, but with external conditions capable of being observed and measured (e.g., geographical features, density of population, amount of sustenance, etc.). An initial difficulty here, however, is the potential circularity of such explanations: “Man, the social human being, intervenes in the former class of conditions: therefore they are, to a certain extent, social facts; to demand from society an explanation of them is partly to take for granted what we purpose to explain” (1914: 197-8). But Boutroux also saw a second difficulty with the effort to derive social facts from external conditions — a difficulty he illustrated by a familiar example:

布特鲁克斯因此转向了第二种选择——也就是说，我们试图将社会事实与能够被观察和测量的外部条件(例如，地理特征、人口密度、维持生计的数量等)联系起来，而不是与它们同样的社会先例联系起来。然而，这里最初的困难是这些解释的潜在循环: “人，社会人类，介入了前一类条件: 因此，在某种程度上，它们是社会事实; 要求社会对它们作出解释，部分是理所当然的，我们的目的是解释”(1914:197-8)。但布特鲁克斯也看到了从外部条件中推断社会事实的第二个困难，他用一个熟悉的例子说明了这个困难:

Suppose, for instance, we explain the development of the division of labor by the progress of social density, the interdependence of the members of a society. The saying of Darwin is recalled, that different beings live side by side more easily than similar beings: they inconvenience one another in a less degree and the struggle for life amongst them is not so keen. Man obtains this salutary diversity by developing division of labor, and so this division of labor shows itself as the necessary result of the struggle for life. Vital competition: a physical cause, thus explains division of labor: a social fact. (1914: 198)

例如，假设我们通过社会密度的进步来解释劳动分工的发展，即社会成员之间的相互依赖。达尔文曾说过，不同的生物比相似的生物更容易并肩生活: 它们给彼此带来的不便程度较低，而且它们之间的生存斗争也不那么激烈。人类通过发展分工来获得这种有益的多样性，因此这种分工显示出它是为生命而斗争的必然结果。生命竞争: 一种物质原因，从而解释了分工: 一个社会事实。(1914:198)

The example, of course, was taken from De la division du travail social (1893), the doctoral thesis defended by Durkheim during the spring of the same year Boutroux’s lectures were given (1984: 200—25). In fact, Durkheim's thesis had been dedicated to Boutroux; but according to Bougle, Boutroux accepted the dedication with a grimace, and according to the Doyen’s report of the defense, Boutroux’s discontent was particularly addressed to Durkheim’s mechanical, necessitarian mode of explanation (Lukes 1972: 296, 297—8). Concerning the “law” that the increase in the division of labor is a direct result of the increasing density and volume of population, for example, Boutroux argued that the increasing division of labor was not the only possible solution. In reply, Durkheim insisted that he “did not wish to show that [his] law was the only possible consequence, but rather that it was a necessary consequence. There are others, but they are secondary and weak” (Lukes 1972: 298). Apparently Boutroux was unhappy with this reply; and he was no happier two years later, when his lectures were published. Does the law stated by Darwin, he asked, necessarily apply when we are dealing with man? Is it correct to say that, in a human society, diversity of functions is invariably a principle of mutual tolerance? “Look at capital and labor,” Boutroux insisted, “the difference that separates them does not prevent them from combating each other. It often happens that diversity of education and occupation inclines men to misunderstand and despise one another. If men are to agree,'' he concluded, “it is not enough that they cannot understand one another” (1914: 198—9).

当然，这个例子来自社会劳动分工(1893) ，迪尔凯姆在布特鲁克斯演讲的同一年春季辩护的博士论文(1984:200ー25)。事实上，迪尔凯姆的论文是写给 Boutroux 的，但是根据 Bougle 的说法，布特鲁克斯接受这个论文的时候是一副苦着脸的样子，而且根据元老的辩护报告，布特鲁克斯的不满特别针对迪尔凯姆机械的、必要的解释模式(卢克斯1972:296,297ー8)。例如，关于劳动分工的增加是人口密度和数量增加的直接结果的“法则”，布特鲁克斯认为，劳动分工的增加不是唯一可能的解决办法。作为回应，涂尔干坚持认为他“并不希望表明[他的]法律是唯一可能的结果，而是一个必然的结果。”。还有其他人，但他们是次要的和软弱的”(路加福音1972:298)。显然，布特鲁克斯对这个回答不满意; 两年后，当他的讲座发表时，他也没有更高兴。他问道，当我们与人类打交道时，达尔文阐述的法则是否一定适用？是否可以说，在人类社会中，功能的多样性总是一个相互容忍的原则？“看看资本和劳动力,”布特鲁克斯坚持说，“区分它们的差异并不能阻止它们相互斗争。教育和职业的多样性往往导致男性相互误解和轻视。如果人们同意,”他总结道，“他们不能互相理解是不够的”(1914:198ー9)。

But even if we accept Durkheim’s argument that the division of labor is a “necessary consequence” of the Darwinian struggle, Boutroux observed, it is surely not “a relation of necessity’’ in the sense of Newtonian mechanics. In Durkheim’s theory, the division of labor is “necessary” in the sense of a condition essential to the realization of a particular end — i.e., the cessation of the struggle for life. “This,” Boutroux emphasized, “is by no means a mechanical and inevitable necessary’’; on the contrary, the struggle for life “admits of other solutions, the simplest of which is the eating of one another. That is really the law of nature, and division of labor is instituted for the very purpose of impeding the fulfillment of this law’’ (1914: 199). The division of labor is “necessary,” therefore, only in the sense of being preferable — i.e., “more in conformity with the idea of humanity, responding more completely to that sympathy with the weak which we assume to exist in man.’’ What can this mean, Boutroux asked, except that “what we took to be a crude law of causality involves a relation of finality, and that we are assuming the intervention of the human intellect and will where we think we are bringing into action none but external and material conditions?” (1914: 199—200). In short, the Durkheim of De la division du travail social was no longer the Durkheim of the Sens lectures, and Boutroux knew it.

但即使我们接受涂尔干的观点，即劳动分工是达尔文主义斗争的“必然结果”，布特鲁克斯观察到，它肯定不是牛顿运动定律意义上的“必然关系”。在迪尔凯姆的理论中，劳动分工是“必要的”，因为它是实现某一特定目标的必要条件，即停止为生命而奋斗。“这,”布特鲁克斯强调，“决不是一种机械的和不可避免的必要”; 相反，对生命的斗争“承认其他的解决办法，其中最简单的是相互吞噬。这确实是自然的法则，分工是为了阻碍这个法则的实现而制定的。”(1914:199)。因此，劳动分工是“必要的”，只是在更可取的意义上，即“更符合人性的观念，更完全地回应我们认为存在于人类中的对弱者的同情。”布特鲁克斯问道，这意味着什么，除了“我们认为是一个粗糙的因果关系法则，涉及到一个终极关系，我们假设人类智慧和意志的干预，我们认为我们正在采取行动，而不是外部和物质条件?”(1914:199ー200)。简而言之，社会劳动分工中的涂尔干不再是森斯讲座中的涂尔干，布特鲁克斯知道这一点。

A second important influence on Durkheim at the Ecole Normale Superieure was the great French historian, Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges (1830±89). Like Boutroux, Fustel himself had been a student at the Ecole Normale, where he studied with Victor Duruy (1811—94), and read the works of Descartes, Montesquieu, Michelet, Tocqueville, and Guizot. When the coup d'etat of Louis Napoleon on December 2, 1851 led to the suppression of non-classical studies, Fustel ®rst studied Latin and Greek, and then drifted into the history of classical antiquity. By then, Fustel had already embraced the inductive method, writing an essay in praise of Bacon that shocked his fellow students.[60](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark71) In 1853, he joined the newly established Ecole francaise d’Athenes, moving to the Lycee Amiens in 1855, then to the Lycee St. Louis in Paris in 1857. Called to the chair of medieval and modern history at the university of Strasbourg in 1860, Fustel’s “vigorous and scholarly lectures’’ produced “phenomenal success’’ and “un enthousiasme naif’’ throughout the next decade (Thompson 1942: 364).

高等师范学校对涂尔干的第二个重要影响是伟大的法国历史学家努马-丹尼斯·甫斯特尔·德·库朗日(1830 ± 89)。和布特鲁克斯一样，福斯特尔本人也曾在诺马尔高等师范学校(Ecole normal)学习，在那里他与维克多 · 杜鲁伊(Victor Duruy，1811-94)一起学习，并阅读了笛卡尔、孟德斯鸠、米歇莱特、托克维尔和 Guizot 的著作。当1851年12月2日路易斯 · 拿破仑的政变导致非古典研究受到压制时，福斯特尔开始学习拉丁语和希腊语，然后进入了古典时代的历史。那时候，福斯特尔已经接受了归纳法，写了一篇赞扬培根的文章，震惊了他的同学。601853年，他加入了新成立的法国雅典学院，1855年搬到了亚眠中学，1857年搬到了 Lycee St. Louis。1860年，福斯特尔被邀请担任中世纪和现代历史斯特拉斯堡大学主席，他的“充满活力和学术性的讲座”在接下来的十年里产生了“巨大的成功”和“非常天真的热情”(汤普森1942:364)。

While in Greece, Fustel collected a number of manuscripts which provided the foundation for his earliest publications, including his Memoire sur l'ile de Chios (1856), the highly praised French thesis, Polybe, ou la Gr'ece conquise (1858), and his Latin thesis, Quid Vestae cultus in institutis veterum privatis publicisque valuerit (1858). But Fustel’s masterpiece remains La Cite antique, written over a six-month period at Strasbourg in 1864, comprising lectures given the two previous years. Initially published at his own expense, the work quickly won Fustel a following at the court of Napoleon III and, by 1890, it had seen its 13th edition. On the recommendation of Duruy (the Emperor’s Minister of Public Instruction), Fustel was called to Paris in February, 1870 to give history lectures at the Ecole Normale.

在希腊期间，福斯特尔收集了大量的手稿，为他最早的出版物奠定了基础，包括他的《关于基奥斯的回忆录》(1856年) ，备受赞誉的法国论文《波利比，或格雷西征服》(1858年) ，以及他的拉丁文论文《私人公共价值机构中的奎德维斯塔文化》(1858年)。但是福斯特尔的杰作《城市》仍然是古董，是1864年在斯特拉斯堡用六个月的时间写成的，包括前两年的演讲。这本书最初是自费出版的，很快就在拿破仑三世的宫廷里赢得了福斯特尔的追随者，到了1890年，这本书已经出了第13版。在杜鲁伊(皇帝的公共教育部长)的推荐下，福斯特尔于1870年2月被召到巴黎师范学院讲授历史。

Fustel’s declared purpose in La Cite antique was “to show upon what principles and by what rules Greek and Roman society was governed’’ (1956: 11). But at least a secondary purpose ± motivated by Fustel’s desire to restore respect for the ancien regime — was to emphasize the radical discontinuity between Greco-Roman and French civilization. French schoolchildren, he complained, learned about the Greeks and Romans from their earliest years, comparing ancient revolutions with their French counterpart, and ancient history with that of 19th-century France. Such comparisons did more than simply perpetuate the misunderstanding of the past, Fustel observed:

福斯特尔在《城市古董》中声明的目的是“展示希腊和罗马社会的治理原则和规则”(1956:11)。但是，至少有一个次要的目的，是为了强调希腊罗马文明和法国文明之间的根本断裂。这个目的的动机是，福斯特尔希望恢复对古代政权的尊重。他抱怨说，法国学童从小就了解希腊人和罗马人，把古代革命与法国革命相比较，把古代历史与19世纪的法国相比较。这种比较不仅仅是延续了对过去的误解，福斯特尔观察到:

Having imperfectly observed the institutions of the ancient city, men have dreamed of reviving them among us. They have deceived themselves about the liberty of the ancients, and on this very account liberty among the moderns has been put in peril. The last eighty years have clearly shown that one of the great difficulties which impede the march of modern society is the habit which it has of always keeping Greek and Roman antiquity before its eyes. (1956: 11)

由于没有完全观察到古城的制度，人们一直梦想着在我们中间复兴这些制度。他们在古人的自由问题上欺骗了自己，正因为如此，现代人的自由已经处于危险之中。过去的八十年清楚地表明，阻碍现代社会前进的最大困难之一就是它总是把希腊和罗马古代摆在眼前的习惯。(1956:11)

But if we study the Greeks and Romans as if they were “entirely foreign,” Fustel suggested, their institutions will be revealed as “absolutely inimitable.” We shall attempt to show by what rules these societies were regulated,” he proposed, “and it will be freely admitted that the same rules can never govern humanity again.” Fearful of that revolutionary intoxication which had identified the ancient heroes with the protagonists of the Terror, therefore, Fustel “deepened the gulf which separates our conflicts from the ancient ones and made it virtually unbridgeable.”[61](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark72)

但是如果我们研究希腊人和罗马人，就像他们“完全是外国人”一样，福斯特尔建议，他们的制度将被揭示为“绝对独一无二”我们将试图表明，这些社会是由什么样的规则来管理的,”他提出，“而且人们将自由地承认，同样的规则再也不能管理人类了。”由于害怕那种将古代英雄与恐怖主义主人公联系在一起的革命性的陶醉，因此，福斯特尔“加深了我们与古代冲突之间的鸿沟，使其几乎无法跨越。”61

Such an emphasis on the discontinuity between past and present presupposed an explanation for the transition from one to the other; and for Fustel — as Durkheim would later complain — this explanation was provided by the progress of the human mind (1984: 178—9). In the present, Fustel argued, “[m]an has not . . . the way of thinking that he had twenty-®ve centuries ago; and this is why he is no longer governed as he was governed then.'' For Fustel, therefore, institutions provided no explanation of their associated beliefs. When we examine the institutions of the Greeks and Romans, they appear obscure, whimsical, and inexplicable; but when we examine their religious ideas, these institutional practices become quite transparent. “If, on going back to the first ages of this race,” Fustel observed, “we observe the idea which it had of human existence, of life, of death, of a second life, of the divine principle, we perceive a close relation between these opinions and the ancient rules of private law; between the rites which spring from these opinions and their political institutions” (1956: 12, 13). La Cite antique, Fustel thus explained in his conclusion, describes the history of a belief — i.e., the belief in a life after death. When that belief was established, “human society was constituted. It was modi®ed, and society underwent a series of revolutions. It disappeared, and society changed its character.''[62](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark73)

这种对过去和现在之间不连续性的强调预先假定了对从一个过渡到另一个过渡的解释; 对于菲斯特尔——正如涂尔干后来抱怨的那样——这种解释是由人类心灵的进步提供的(1984:178-9)。目前，福斯特尔辩称: “(米兰)没有... ... 25个世纪前的思维方式; 这就是为什么他不再像当时那样被统治。”因此，对于福斯特尔，机构没有提供解释他们相关的信仰。当我们审视希腊人和罗马人的制度时，他们看起来晦涩、古怪和难以解释; 但是当我们审视他们的宗教思想时，这些制度实践变得相当透明。福斯特尔评论道: “如果我们追溯到这个种族的最初时代，我们观察到人类存在、生命、死亡、第二次生命、神圣原则的观念，我们就会发现这些观念与私法的古老规则、源于这些观念的仪式与它们的政治制度之间有着密切的关系。”(1956:12,13)。福斯特尔在他的结论中这样解释道，《城市的古董》描述了一种信仰的历史，即对死后生命的信仰。当这种信念建立起来时，“人类社会就形成了。它经过了改造，社会经历了一系列的革命。它消失了，社会改变了它的性质。“62

Fustel's description of this history ± with its account of communal sacri®ces, the priority of ritual over belief, the essentially religious nature of all human association, the integrative function of religious practices, religious doctrine as the mere symbol of some deeper, underlying reality ± powerfully evokes the ideas of Les Formes elementaires. And when Fustel turns from the idea itself to its effect on social institutions, he adopts the vocabulary of social realism. Consistent with familial independence, for example, the belief in souls of the dead required that the dwellings and grave sites of each family be separated from those of others. Both the hearth and the burial place had to be bound to a speci®c location, lest the families become confounded and the worship of one's own ancestors neglected or even abandoned. Each family thus took possession of a certain plot of land, which thus became imbued with the religious sentiments of its members and eventually their moral responsibility. “Without discussion, without labor, without a shadow of hesitation,'' Fustel thus observed, the ancients thus “arrived, at a single step, and merely by virtue of their belief, at the conception of the right of property; this right from which all civilization springs, since by it man improves the soil, and becomes improved himself'' (1956: 67). This was Fustel's answer to Locke as well as to fashionable theories of primitive communism; and like Durkheim would later, it emphasized the power of social institutions to function independently of individual wills. “Found property on the right of labor,'' Fustel observed, “and man may dispose of it. Found it on religion, and he can no longer do this; a tie stronger than the will of man binds the land to him'' (1956: 70±1; Momigliano 1982: 333).

福斯特尔对这段历史的描述，以及对公共祭祀的描述，仪式优先于信仰，所有人类联合的本质宗教性质，宗教实践的整合功能，宗教教义仅仅作为一些更深层次的、潜在的现实的象征，强有力地唤起了 Les Formes 的基本思想。当福斯特尔从观念本身转向它对社会制度的影响时，他采用了社会现实主义的词汇。例如，与家庭独立相一致的是，对死者灵魂的信仰要求将每个家庭的住所和墓地与其他家庭的住所和墓地分开。火炉和墓地都必须绑定在一个特定的位置，以免家庭成为混乱和自己的祖先崇拜忽视甚至放弃。因此，每个家庭都占有一块土地，这块土地充满了家庭成员的宗教情感，最终成为他们的道德责任。“没有讨论，没有劳动，没有犹豫的影子,”福斯特尔这样评论道，古人因此“一步到位，仅仅凭借他们的信仰，达到了财产权的概念; 这种权利是所有文明的源泉，因为人类通过它改善了土壤，并且改善了自己”(1956:67)。这是福斯特尔对洛克的回答，也是对流行的原始共产主义理论的回答; 就像涂尔干后来所做的那样，它强调了社会制度独立于个人意志运作的力量。“在劳动权上发现了财产,”福斯特尔说，“人们可以处置它。”。在宗教上发现了它，他不能再这样做了; 一条比人的意志更强大的纽带将土地与他联系在一起”(1956:70 ± 1; Momigliano 1982:333)。

Law, government, and ethics followed a similar evolution. Upon its emergence, the ancient city found the law of the family already established and deeply rooted in custom and habitual observance. Far from being instituted by some ancient legislator, therefore, the law rather had its birth in the religious authority of the father, and was thus imposed upon the legislator, who adapted it to the needs of the city by degrees. Ancient law “had its birth in the family,” Fustel thus observed. “It sprang up spontaneously from the ancient principles which gave it root. It flowed from the religious belief which was universally admitted in the primitive age of these peoples, which exercised its empire over their intelligence and their wills” (1956: 86). As for ethics, if Fustel resisted the notion that ancient religion created moral sentiments, he at least suggested that these religious beliefs were associated with the “natural sentiments” of morality, in such a way as to “fortify them, to give them greater authority, to assure their supremacy and their right of direction over the conduct of man” (1956: 95). For the moral sentiments were initially limited to the mutual duties and obligations of members of the same family, and only later insensibly evolved to comprise the duties of citizens, and eventually those prescribed by natural law. Fustel thus accounted for the “religious aura” of moral commands by referring his readers to their evolutionary origins in the institution of the family, whose own authority, as we have seen, was based upon the ancient religion (1956: 97 8).

法律、政府和道德也有类似的演变。在它出现的时候，古代城市发现家庭法已经建立并深深植根于习俗和习惯的遵守。因此，这项法律远非由某些古代立法者制定的，而是诞生于父亲的宗教权威，因此强加于立法者，立法者逐渐使之适应城市的需要。福斯特尔这样评论道，古老的法律“在家族中诞生”。“它是从古老的原则中自发产生的，这些原则使它生根发芽。它源于这些民族在原始时代被普遍接受的宗教信仰，这种信仰在他们的智慧和意志上行使帝国的权力”(1956:86)。至于伦理学，如果福斯特尔反对古代宗教创造道德情感的观点，他至少认为这些宗教信仰与道德的“自然情感”有关，以这样一种方式“强化它们，给予它们更大的权威，以确保它们的至高无上和对人类行为的指导权”(1956:95)。因为道德情感最初仅限于同一家庭成员的相互义务和责任，后来才不知不觉地演变成包括公民的义务，最终包括自然法规定的义务。因此，福斯特尔解释了道德命令的“宗教光环”，他提到他的读者在家庭制度的进化起源，其自身的权威，正如我们所看到的，是基于古老的宗教(1956:978)。

In 1893, Durkheim would criticize Fustel for deriving these early forms of social organization from religious ideas; but in fact, Fustel’s subsequent treatment of the evolution of legal, moral, and religious ideas placed enormous emphasis on changing forms of social organization, in a manner similar to the conclusion of the second book of Les Formes elementaires. A certain number of families, Fustel suggested, joined together to form a group (the Greek phratry or the Latin curia): “Even at the moment when they united,’’ he added, “these families conceived the idea of a divinity superior to that of the household, one who was common to all, and who watched over the entire group. They raised an altar to him, lighted a sacred fire, and founded a worship’’ (1956: 118). When several phratries or curias joined together, for ming a tribe, another religion was formed; and when several tribes gathered to found the confederation which constituted the ancient city, still another, more comprehensive worship was established. Speaking particularly of the confederation, Fustel emphasized the role played by religion in creating a social bond among people who were otherwise quite diverse, free, and inconstant:

1893年，迪尔凯姆批评福斯特尔从宗教思想中衍生出这些早期的社会组织形式; 但事实上，福斯特尔后来对法律、道德和宗教思想进化的论述，极大地强调了社会组织形式的变化，其方式类似于第二本《形式的基本要素》的结论。福斯特尔建议，一定数量的家庭联合起来组成一个团体(希腊族或拉丁教廷) : “即使在他们联合起来的那一刻,”他补充说，“这些家庭构思了一个高于家庭的神性概念，一个对所有人都普遍存在的神性概念，一个监督整个团体的神性概念。他们为他举起祭坛，点燃圣火，建立敬拜”(1956:118)。当几个胞族或居里亚联合在一起，为了明一个部落，另一个宗教形成; 当几个部落聚集在一起，建立联邦，构成古城，还有另一个，更全面的崇拜建立。尤其是在谈到联邦时，福斯特尔强调了宗教在建立社会纽带方面所发挥的作用，而这种纽带在其他方面是相当多样化、自由和反复无常的:

To bring them under the rules of a community, to institute commandments and ensure obedience, to cause passions to give way to reason, and individual right to public right, there certainly was something necessary, stronger than material force, more respectable than interest, surer than a philosophical theory, more unchangeable than a convention; something that should dwell equally in all hearts, and should be all powerful there. (1956: 132)

为了让他们遵守一个社会的规则，制定戒律，确保服从，让激情让位于理性，让个人权利让位于公共权利，当然有一些必要的东西，比物质力量更强大，比利益更受尊重，比哲学理论更可靠，比惯例更不可改变; 一些东西应该平等地存在于所有人的心中，并且应该在那里具有强大的力量。(1956:132)

This passage bears a resemblance to Montesquieu's argument, in De l'esprit des lois, that the Romans adopted such a religion in order to restrain their people; but Fustel resisted such comparisons, insisting that religion could not have had so arti®cial an origin, and also that “every religion that has come to sustain itself only from motives of public utility, has not stood long'' (1956: 166). On the contrary, for Fustel, the state presupposed religion far more than religion was an instrument of the state. It was not force, Fustel observed, that created the chiefs and kings in those ancient cities: “Authority flowed from the worship of the sacred fire. Religion created the king in the city, as it had made the family chief in the house'' (1956: 178). Just as Durkheim would later argue that a contract presumes, not just a divergence of individual interests, but also some underlying agreement of wills and har monious collaboration, Fustel argued that, in ancient society, a legal relationship between two men required a prior religious relationship - i.e., “that they should worship at the same hearth and have the same sacrifices. When this religious community did not exist, it did not seem that there could be any legal relation'' (Durkheim 1984: 162; Fustel 1956: 193). Citizenship itself was established entirely on religious grounds; and the stranger, by contrast, was “one who has not access to the worship, one whom the gods of the city do not protect, and who has not even the right to invoke them'' (1956: 194—5; cf. Smith 1972: 121—4).

这段论法的精神与孟德斯鸠的观点有相似之处，即罗马人接受这样一种宗教是为了约束他们的人民，但福斯特尔反对这种比较，坚持认为宗教不可能有如此人为的起源，而且“每一种仅仅出于公共利益的动机而维持自己的宗教，并没有长期存在”(1956:166)。相反，对 Fustel 来说，国家预先假定宗教远远超过宗教是国家的工具。福斯特尔观察到，并不是武力创造了这些古代城市的酋长和国王: “权力来自对圣火的崇拜。宗教创造了城市中的国王，就像它创造了家庭中的首领一样”(1956:178)。正如迪尔凯姆后来提出的，契约不仅假定个人利益的分歧，而且还假定一些潜在的意愿协议和和谐的合作，福斯特尔认为，在古代社会，两个男人之间的法律关系需要一个先前的宗教关系，即，“他们应该在同一个炉灶礼拜，并有相同的牺牲。当这个宗教团体不存在时，似乎不可能有任何法律关系”(迪尔凯姆1984:162; 福斯特尔1956:193)。公民身份本身完全建立在宗教的基础上; 相比之下，陌生人是“一个无法进入礼拜的人，一个城市的神没有保护的人，一个甚至没有权利援引他们的人”(1956:194ー5; 参考史密斯1972:121ー4)。

So at every level — family, phratry or curia, tribe, the confederation of the ancient city itself — the function of religion was the same: i.e., “among the ancients, what formed the bond of every society was a worship'' (1956: 146). The point toward which all these observations conspired, as we have already seen, was that the ancient city enjoyed nothing even remotely comparable to what we would call “liberty.” Indeed, ancient peoples “had not even the idea of it,'' Fustel argued. “They did not believe that there could exist any right as against the city and its gods.'' So Fustel's account of ancient society, as Durkheim surely recognized and appreciated, unremittingly stressed the superficiality of merely political freedom: “To have political rights, to vote, to name magistrates, to have the privilege of being archon — this was called liberty,'' Fustel emphasized, “but man was not the less enslaved to the state'' (1956: 223). Only after the 7th century B.C., when this ancient social organization was attacked by those classes deprived of its advantages and, still later, when the triumph of Christianity introduced the separation of Church and State, did government become free of religious constraint. Henceforth, Fustel concluded, “only a part of man belonged to society,” for, “in what related to his soul, he was free, and was bound only to God” (1956: 394). Private virtues thus became distinguished from their public counterparts, and the freedom of the individual - i.e., the possibility of elevating the former over the latter — became conceivable.

因此，在每一个层面ーー家庭、胞族或教廷、部落、古城邦联本身ーー宗教的功能是相同的: 即，“在古人中间，形成每个社会的纽带是一种崇拜”(1956:146)。正如我们已经看到的那样，所有这些观察结果的共同点是，这座古老的城市享有的东西与我们所说的“自由”根本不可同日而语事实上，古代人“甚至没有这个想法,”福斯特尔争辩道。“他们不相信存在任何反对这座城市和它的神的权利。”因此，正如迪尔凯姆肯定承认和赞赏的那样，福斯特尔对古代社会的描述，不断强调仅仅是政治自由的肤浅性: “拥有政治权利、选举权、任命治安官、享有执政官的特权——这就是所谓的自由,”福斯特尔强调，“但人并不是更少地被国家奴役”(1956:223)。只有在前7世纪之后，当这个古老的社会组织受到那些剥夺其优势的阶级的攻击，再后来，当基督教的胜利引入了教会与国家关系，政府才摆脱了宗教的束缚。从此以后，福斯特尔总结道，“人只属于社会的一部分,”因为，“在与他的灵魂有关的事情上，他是自由的，只与上帝有约束力”(1956:394)。因此，私人的美德与公共的美德区别开来，个人的自由——即将前者提升到后者之上的可能性——变得可以想象。

La Cite antique enjoyed an almost instantaneous celebrity, and has remained a classic of French historiography; and of course it was awash with linguistic resources that a later generation would almost unconsciously recognize as “Durkheimian” — e.g., the comparative method; a preoccupation with the family as the most elementary form of society; the use of evolutionary “survivals” to reconstruct beliefs and practices for which evidence was lacking; the insistence on the discontinuity between societies of different types; the dismissal of explanations that appeal to individual reason or will; the discovery of the origin of religion in a primitive form of sacrificial communion with a god; a rejection of the concern for variable religious doctrine combined with an emphasis on the stability of ritual practices; the religious origins of institutions like private property, law, and the state; and the identification of “religion” with “society” itself. Camille Jullian, who edited six volumes of Fustel’s manuscripts after his death in 1889, was Durkheim’s classmate at the Ecole Normale and his colleague at Bordeaux. “From his time at the Ecole Normale,” Jullian would later observe, Durkheim “was profoundly affected by the influence of The Ancient City, and by the lectures and the example of its author. He himself has recognized this and proclaims it openly’’ (Lukes 1972: 60). Evans-Pritchard insisted that Fustel and Montesquieu “had a greater formative influence on Durkheim’s thought than Saint-Simon and Comte’’ (Lukes 1972: 63 n. 93). There can be “no doubt,’’ Momigliano agreed in 1982, “about Fustel’s influence on Durkheim’’ (1982: 339). But as we’ve seen, only two of these ideas — the comparative method and the notion of the family as the evolutionary origin of society — make any appearance in the Sens lectures; and though each of these ideas would later assume an important place within Durkheim’s larger, social realist vocabulary, they bore not the slightest connection with such language in 1883. If Durkheim had indeed been “profoundly affected” by La Cite antique — and there seems little reason to doubt that he was ± Fustel’s classic work seems to have provided linguistic resources for a project that Durkheim had not yet conceived.

《城市》中的古董几乎一夜成名，一直是法国历史学的经典之作; 当然，它充满了语言资源，后代人几乎不知不觉地认为它是“涂尔干语”ーー例如。比照法，对家庭作为社会最基本形式的关注，利用进化的“幸存者”来重建缺乏证据的信仰和实践，坚持不同类型的社会之间的不连续性，驳回诉诸个人理性或意志的解释，发现宗教起源于与上帝的祭祀交流的原始形式;反对对多变的宗教教义的关注，同时强调仪式实践的稳定性; 私有财产、法律和国家等机构的宗教渊源; 以及“宗教”与“社会”本身的认同。卡米尔 · 朱利安(Camille Jullian)是迪尔凯姆在诺马尔学院的同学，也是他在波尔多的同事。朱利安在1889年去世后编辑了六卷福斯特的手稿。“从他在师范学院的时候,”朱利安后来评论道，涂尔干“就深受《古城》的影响，以及作者的演讲和榜样的影响。他自己已经认识到了这一点，并且公开地宣布了这一点”(路加福音1972:60)。埃文斯-普里查德坚持认为，福斯特尔和孟德斯鸠“对迪尔凯姆思想的形成影响比圣西蒙和伯爵更大”(卢克斯1972:63 n.93)。“毫无疑问,”莫米利亚诺在1982年同意，“关于福斯特尔对涂尔干的影响”(1982:339)。但正如我们所看到的，这些观点中只有两个——比照法和家庭作为社会进化起源的观点——出现在森斯的讲座中，尽管这些观点后来在迪尔凯姆更大的社会现实主义词汇中占有重要地位，但它们与1883年的这种语言没有丝毫联系。如果涂尔干确实受到了《城市》古董的“深刻影响”ーー而且似乎没有什么理由怀疑他是 ± Fustel 的经典作品，似乎为涂尔干尚未构思的项目提供了语言资源。

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Sens lectures is their enthusiasm ± notably absent in Janet’s textbook ± for a moral vocabulary including phrases like the “principle of finality’’ and “perfecting of our personality.” The interesting possibility here is that, by 1883, Durkheim had fallen under the spell of the neo-Kantian philosopher Charles Renouvier (1815—1903). Born at Montpellier, Renouvier studied mathematics and natural science from 1834 to 1836 at the Ecole Polytechnique, where Auguste Comte was his instructor. Upon graduation, Renouvier ± whose family fortune made it unnecessary for him to work, and also subsidized the publication of his books ± dabbled in Parisian intellectual and political life, falling under the influence of Saint-Simonian groups. With the abdication of Louis-Philippe in 1848, these groups hoped that the provisional government of the February Revolution would create opportunities for political and social reform; and when Hippolyte Carnot, the minister of instruction, called for a manual of civic rights and duties for use in the education of the newly enfranchised masses, Renouvier responded with his Manuel republicain de l'homme et du citoyen (1848). When the conservative majority of the new Constituent Assembly got wind of the Manuel’s radical content, they used it to force Carnot ± and Renouvier as well ± out of the government. The coup d'etat of Napoleon III (December 2, 1851) marginalized Renouvier still further, and by 1866 he had settled permanently in the south of France where he wrote his Science de la morale (1869) and other works.

也许森斯讲座最引人注目的方面是他们对道德词汇的热情在珍妮特的教科书中明显缺失，这些词汇包括“终极原则”和“完善我们的个性”有趣的是，到1883年，迪尔凯姆已经被新康德主义哲学家查尔斯 · 雷诺维耶(Charles Renouvier，1815-1903)迷住了。雷诺维耶出生于蒙彼利埃，1834年至1836年在巴黎综合理工学院学习数学和自然科学，奥古斯特•孔德是他的导师。毕业后，Renouvier ± 的家庭财产使他不必工作，并且资助他的书出版，他涉足巴黎的知识分子和政治生活，受到圣西蒙团体的影响。1848年路易-菲利普退位后，这些团体希望二月革命的临时政府能够为政治和社会改革创造机会，当教育部长希波吕忒 · 卡诺(Hippolyte Carnot)呼吁编写一本公民权利和义务手册，用于教育新获得选举权的群众时，雷诺维耶以他的《人与公民的曼努埃尔共和》(Manuel reRepublic in de l’homme et du citoyen，1848年出版)作为回应。当新制宪议会中的保守派大多数人得知曼纽尔的激进内容后，他们利用这一点迫使卡诺和雷诺维耶也退出政府。拿破仑三世(1851年12月2日)的政变进一步边缘化了雷诺维耶，到1866年，他在法国南部永久定居，在那里他写了他的《道德科学》(1869)和其他作品。

“If you wish to mature your thought,’’ Durkheim later remarked to Rene Maublanc, “devote yourself to the study of a great master; take a system apart, laying bare its innermost secrets. That is what I did and my educator was Renouvier’’ (Lukes 1972: 54). Most of the scholarly discussion has concerned Renouvier’s influence on Durkheim’s sociological method and sociology of knowledge, particularly as mediated by the French neo-Kantian Octave Hamelin, Durkheim’s friend and colleague at the university of Bordeaux between 1887 and 1902 (Stedman-Jones 1995; Lukes 1972: 54—8). But Georges Davy made it clear that Durkheim was inspired by Renouvier while still a student at the Ecole Normale (1879—82). “It was at this time,’’ Davy observed, “that Durkheim began to immerse himself in the reading and reflection on Renouvier, which marked him so deeply” (Davy 1919: 8). Connecting the Sens lectures to Renouvier is tricky, because the notes are Lalande’s, not Durkheim’s, and Renouvier is never mentioned by name (nor, for that matter, are Boutroux or Fustel); but there are certainly enough similarities to warrant further investigation.

迪尔凯姆后来对雷内 · 莫布兰克说: “如果你想使自己的思想成熟起来，就要致力于研究一位伟大的大师; 把一个系统拆开，揭开它最深处的秘密。这就是我所做的，我的教育者是雷诺维耶”(路加福音1972:54)。大多数学术讨论都关注雷诺维耶对涂尔干社会学方法和知识社会学的影响，尤其是在法国新康德派作家奥克塔夫 · 哈梅林(Octave Hamelin)的调解下。哈梅林是涂尔干在1887年至1902年间的波尔多大学朋友和同事(斯特德曼-琼斯1995; 卢克斯1972:54ー8)。但是乔治 · 戴维明确表示，迪尔凯姆的灵感来自雷诺维耶，当时他还是师范学院的学生(1879-82)。“正是在这个时候,”戴维说，“涂尔干开始沉浸在对雷诺维耶的阅读和思考中，这给他留下了如此深刻的印象”(戴维1919:8)。将森斯的演讲与雷诺维耶联系起来是很棘手的，因为这些笔记是拉兰德的，而不是迪尔凯姆的，而且雷诺维耶从未被提及过名字(就此而言，布特鲁克斯和福斯特尔也没有提及) ; 但它们之间肯定有足够的相似之处，值得进一步调查。

Like the Sens lecturer, for example, Renouvier not only rejected Kant’s distinction between the noumenal and phenomenal worlds, insisting that they were one and the same, but also attacked the Kantian theory of antinomies. Appealing to the principle of noncontradiction, for example, he insisted that the idea of an infinite series of phenomena or the infinity of space implied the incoherent notion of an infinite number, and were thus disproved. In the field of ethics, Renouvier denied the distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives, insisting that duty, feeling, and inclination should ideally accompany one another. The moral law was then reformulated as one commanding us to realize, as fully as possible, our personality; and from this duty Renouvier derived all human rights and liberties. Virtues are those dispositions that advance the ful®llment of these ends; and justice was de®ned as a reciprocal respect for the efforts of others to realize their ends. Like Kant — and the Sens lecturer — Renouvier considered morality inconceivable unless freedom is an attribute of the individual human being; and as he retreated from his earlier, socialist views, Renouvier shared the Sens lecturer’s disdain for any political theory that lacked respect for the individual moral agency, as well as the later Durkheim’s anticlericalism and enthusiasm for secular education (Logue 1993: 60—95; Copleston 1977: 160—7; Boas 1967b: 180—2). Durkheim’s earliest publication, “Du role des grands hommes dans la societe’’ (1883) — an address given to these same lyceens at Sens — can be read as a Renouvierist critique of Ernest Renan’s Dialogues et fragments philosophiques (1876) (1973a: 25—6). If Renouvier’s Science de la morale (1869) really is the model for those of the Sens lectures concerned with ethics, then Durkheim had clearly embraced a highly teleological and personalist conception of ethics while still a student at the Ecole Normale Superieure.

例如，就像森斯的讲师一样，雷诺维耶不仅拒绝了康德对本体世界和现象世界的区分，坚持认为它们是一体的，而且还攻击了康德的二律背反理论。例如，他诉诸于不矛盾原则，坚持认为无限系列现象或空间无限的概念暗示了无限数的不连贯概念，因此被推翻了。在伦理学领域，雷诺维耶否认绝对命令和假设命令之间的区别，坚持认为责任、感觉和倾向应该理想地相互伴随。那时，道德法则被重新制定为一个命令我们尽可能充分地实现我们的人格的法则; 而雷诺维耶就是从这个责任中衍生出了所有的人权和自由。美德是那些促进这些目的充分实现的性情; 正义被定义为对他人为实现其目的所作努力的相互尊重。和康德ーー以及森斯的讲师ーー一样，雷诺维耶认为道德是不可思议的，除非自由是个人的一个属性; 当他从他早期的社会主义观点中退出时，雷诺维耶和森斯的讲师一样，对任何缺乏对个人道德能动性的尊重的政治理论嗤之以鼻，后来迪尔凯姆的反教权主义和对世俗教育的热情也是如此(Logue 1993:60ー95; Copleston 1977:160ー7; Boas 1967b: 180ー2)。涂尔干最早的出版物《社会中大人物的角色》(1883年)——一篇给参议院这些学生的演讲——可以被解读为对欧内斯特 · 雷南(Ernest Renan)的《对话录》和《哲学碎片》(1876年)(1973a: 25ー6)的革新主义批评。如果雷诺维尔的《道德科学》(1869)真的是那些关于伦理学的森斯讲座的典范，那么迪尔凯姆显然在还是高等师范学校学生的时候就已经接受了高度目的论和个人主义的伦理学概念。

In sum, the Sens lectures rather clearly do not reinforce what Quentin Skinner has called our “carefully contrived pleasures of recognition” (1984: 202, 197—8). On the contrary, the lectures contain a number of ideas — e.g., the surprisingly teleological, personalist conception of ethics; the embracement of the method of “internal reflection,” combined with a dismissal of the very possibility of unconscious psychological phenomena; the Kantian rejection of any empirical explanation of human reason; the rejection of Kant’s distinction between hypothetical and categorical imperatives; the insistence that moral judgments are essentially personal and subjective — that are not recognizably “Durkheimian” at all. There are other ideas, of course, that are more familiar — e.g., the Boutrouxian view that each science has its distinctive object and method; the notion that logic, ethics, and metaphysics could be grounded in empirical science; the Bernardian conception of experimental verification; the critique of utilitarianism; and the insistence that the distinction between egoism and altruism is to be found, not in the different kinds of pleasures we seek, but rather in the different kinds of objects to which we become attached. But even these ideas are found in new contexts, frequently accompanied by strange silences — e.g., the empirical science in which logic, ethics, and metaphysics should be grounded is philosophical psychology, not sociology; there is no indication of how experimental verification might be applied to the study of the “moral sciences’’; the Smith-like preoccupation with the material — by contrast with the moral — consequences of the division of labor; the dismissal of the expiatory function of punishment; and — the distinction between egoism and altruism notwithstanding — there is no suggestion that our attachment for objects outside us presupposes their representations within us. And most surprisingly — despite his Leibnitzian, epistemological realism — the Sens lecturer was clearly not a social realist, and even seems to have lacked sociological sensibilities altogether.

总而言之，森斯的讲座显然没有强化昆廷•斯金纳(Quentin Skinner)所说的我们“精心设计的获得认可的快乐”(1984:202,197ー8)。相反，这些讲座包含了许多观点，例如，令人惊讶的目的论，个人主义的伦理概念; 接受“内在反思”的方法，结合对无意识心理现象的可能性的否定; 康德拒绝对人类理性的任何经验解释; 拒绝康德对假设命令和绝对命令之间的区别; 坚持道德判断本质上是个人的和主观的ー根本不能识别的“涂尔干式”。当然，还有其他更为人所熟悉的观点ーー例如，布特鲁先的观点认为，每种科学都有其独特的对象和方法; 逻辑、伦理和形而上学可以建立在经验科学基础上的观点; 伯纳德的实验验证观点; 对功利主义的批判; 以及坚持认为，利己主义和利他主义之间的区别不在于我们寻求的不同种类的乐趣，而在于我们所依附的不同种类的对象。但即使是这些观点也是在新的背景下被发现的，经常伴随着奇怪的沉默ーー例如，逻辑、伦理和形而上学应该建立在哲学心理学而不是社会学的基础上的实证科学; 没有迹象表明实验验证如何应用于“道德科学”的研究; 斯密式的对物质的专注ーー与劳动分工的道德ーー后果形成对比; 对惩罚的赎罪功能的摒弃; 以及ーー尽管存在利己主义和利他主义之间的区别ーー没有迹象表明我们对外在事物的依恋预先假定了它们在我们内。最令人惊讶的是ーー尽管他是莱布尼茨主义的认识论现实主义者ーー这位森斯的讲师显然不是一位社会现实主义者，甚至似乎完全缺乏社会学意识。

Under these circumstances, it’s not inappropriate to wonder if these lectures were actually given by Durkheim or, assuming they were, that they really represented his views. But there seems little reason to doubt that Durkheim was the Sens lecturer. Quite aside from the fact that he did teach philosophy at the Lycee de Sens from November, 1882 to February, 1884, and that Lalande was a student there during this period, the format and content of the notes are consistent with a description of the course given by Lalande himself in 1958 (1960: 24). The meticulous outlines that precede each lecture in the notes, for example, seem to reflect Durkheim’s practice — described by Lalande in 1958 — of writing similar outlines on the blackboard at the conclusion of each class. In 1958, Lalande recalled that Durkheim had discussed Schopenhauer — a figure unknown to Lalande’s fellow students — and Schopenhauer indeed appears frequently in the notes. Finally, Lalande’s report that some of Durkheim’s students followed him to St. Quentin in 1884 is consistent with a parenthetical remark on the first page of the notes: “La fin, qu’il n’a pas donnee parce qu’il a ete nomme a St. Quentin, a ete reprise sur les notes d’un eleve de 1882—1883’’ (Gross 1996; Lalande 1960: 25).

在这种情况下，怀疑这些讲座实际上是迪尔凯姆做的，或者假设它们真的代表了迪尔凯姆的观点，是不合适的。但似乎没有什么理由怀疑涂尔干是森斯的讲师。事实上，从1882年11月到1884年2月，他确实在森斯中学教授哲学，而且拉兰德在这段时间里是那里的学生，这些笔记的格式和内容与拉兰德本人在1958年(1960:24)给出的课程描述是一致的。例如，笔记中每堂课之前的一丝不苟的提纲，似乎反映了迪尔凯姆在每堂课结束时在黑板上写下类似提纲的做法(拉兰德在1958年描述了这种做法)。1958年，拉兰德回忆说，涂尔干曾讨论过叔本华——拉兰德的同学们不知道这个人物——而叔本华的确经常出现在笔记中。最后，拉兰德关于迪尔凯姆的一些学生在1884年跟随他来到圣昆廷的报告，与笔记第一页上的一句插入语是一致的: “最后，他没有被授予，因为他被命名为圣昆廷，这是对1882-1883年的笔记的重复”(Gross 1996; Lalande 1960:25)。

The second question — of whether the lectures really represented Durkheim’s views — should be treated more cautiously. As we have seen, the authority of Cousin’s syllabus endured well into the 1880s, and the responsibility of the lycee professor was to prepare students for the baccalaureat. So there was pressure from both students and administration to avoid deviation. Most of the lycee professors thus patterned their lectures after one of several officially approved textbooks, and the most likely model for Durkheim’s lectures would have been Paul Janet’s Traite elementaire de philosophie a l’usage des classes (1879). Even a preliminary comparison of Lalande’s notes with Janet’s textbook, however, suggests that if Durkheim outwardly conformed to the syllabus, he exercised numerous philosophical liberties as well (Gross 1996). There are extremely important arguments in the notes — e.g., the teleological ethics based upon ideas of “personality’’ and “finality’’ — that are completely absent from the textbook; and where the arguments in the textbook and the notes do coincide, the reasons given by Durkheim for accepting or rejecting these arguments frequently differ from those given by Janet.

第二个问题ーー这些讲座是否真正代表了涂尔干的观点ーー应该更谨慎地对待。正如我们所看到的，Cousin 教学大纲的权威性一直延续到19世纪80年代，而中学教授的职责就是为学生的中学毕业考试做准备。因此，来自学生和管理部门的压力要求避免偏差。因此，大多数中学教授的讲座都是按照官方批准的几本教科书中的一本进行的，而迪尔凯姆的讲座最有可能的模式是保罗 · 珍妮特(Paul Janet)的《哲学的基本原理和课程的使用》(Traite Elementtaire de  879)。然而，即使是将拉兰德的笔记与珍妮特的教科书进行初步比较，也表明，如果涂尔干在外表上符合教学大纲，那么他也行使了大量的哲学自由(Gross 1996)。笔记中有一些极其重要的论点ーー例如，基于“个性”和“终结”观点的目的论伦理学ーー在教科书中完全没有提到; 而且，在教科书和笔记中的论点确实重合的地方，迪尔凯姆接受或拒绝这些论点的理由往往与珍妮特给出的不同。

Finally, while the extent to which they lack sociological sensibilities is somewhat surprising, the Sens lectures are not entirely inconsistent with what we’ve known for some time about Durkheim’s early intellectual development. In 1928, Marcel Mauss recalled that, at the time of his agregation (1882), Durkheim had already settled upon the relations between individualism and socialism as the theme for his doctoral dissertation; but he did not see the topic as particularly “sociological,’’ and rather approached it in an abstract, philosophical manner. By 1883, Durkheim had refined his focus to the relations between the individual personality and social solidarity; but here again, there is no reason to think “individual personality’’ meant anything other than what it meant to the Sens lecturer and to Renouvier. So it was only between the first plan of the work, in 1884, and its first draft, in 1886, Lukes observes, that Durkheim decided that the problem belonged to “the new science of sociology” (1972: 66-7). And it was during the same period, of course, that Durkheim made his visit to the universities of Berlin, Marburg, and — most importantly — Leipzig.

最后，尽管他们缺乏社会学敏感性的程度有些令人惊讶，但是 Sens 的讲座并不完全与我们一段时间以来对涂尔干早期智力发展的了解不一致。1928年，马塞尔 · 莫斯回忆说，在他集结时(1882年) ，涂尔干已经确定了个人主义和社会主义之间的关系作为他博士论文的主题，但是他并不认为这个主题特别“社会学”，而是以一种抽象的、哲学的方式来处理它。到了1883年，涂尔干已经把他的重点放在了个人人格和社会团结之间的关系上; 但是在这里，没有理由认为“个人人格”意味着除了它对森斯讲师和雷诺维耶意味着什么以外的任何东西。因此，卢克斯观察到，只有在1884年的第一份工作计划和1886年的第一份草案之间，涂尔干才认定这个问题属于“社会学新科学”(1972:66-7)。当然，正是在同一时期，涂尔干访问了柏林、马堡的大学，最重要的是访问了莱比锡大学。

# A l’ecole des choses 什么东西的学校
 
In three successive volumes over the period 1905-7, the Catholic philosophy journal Revue neo-scolastique published a series of essays collectively titled “Le Conflit de la morale et de la sociologie.” These essays, published as a book in 1911, were written by the Belgian priest and neo-Thomist philosopher Simon Deploige, and they contained a sharp attack on the social realism of Durkheim and his disciples. “All these views,” Deploige observed after summarizing Durkheim’s sociology, “pass in France as M. Durkheim’s own. But they are of German origin’’ (1911: 122).

在1905年至1907年期间，天主教哲学杂志 Revue neo-colastics 连续出版了三卷，发表了一系列文章，题为《道德与社会学的冲突》这些散文于1911年出版成书，作者是比利时神父、新托马斯主义哲学家西蒙 · 德普洛伊奇，它们对涂尔干及其门徒的社会现实主义进行了尖锐的抨击。“所有这些观点,”德普洛伊在总结了涂尔干的社会学之后说，“在法国都是涂尔干自己的观点。但他们是德国血统”(1911:122)。

Durkheim was deeply offended. Had Deploige “wanted to convince people that I have abused my compatriots,’’ he replied on October 20, 1907, “he could hardly have expressed himself in any other way.’’ Deploige’s language seemed to imply that Durkheim had made “carefully concealed borrowings among certain German writers.’’ “I owe much to the Germans,’’ Durkheim admitted, but “the real influence that Germany has exercised on me is quite different from what he says’’ (1907: 606—7). Within four days, Deploige replied with explicit references to Durkheim’s alleged indebtedness to Schaeffle, Wagner, Schmoller, Wundt, Simmel, Lazarus and Steinthal; and a second letter from Durkheim, dated November 8, contained not only a detailed refutation of Deploige’s “errors,” “inaccuracies,” and “insinuations,” but what has surely become the most famous autobiographical passage in all of Durkheim’s writings — i.e., the statement that it was only in 1895, under the influence “of the works of Robertson Smith and his school,’’ that he had first discovered “the means to approach the study of religion sociologically’’ (1913b: 326). Again Deploige replied; and when his essays appeared as a volume in 1911, Durkheim reviewed it savagely in L'Annee sociologique, alluding again to “all that we owe to Robertson Smith and to the works of the ethnographers of England and America” (1913b: 326)

涂尔干被深深地冒犯了。1907年10月20日，德普洛伊奇回答说: “如果德普洛伊奇“想让人们相信我虐待了我的同胞，那么他几乎不可能用其他任何方式表达自己。”德普洛伊奇的语言似乎暗示迪尔凯姆“在某些德国作家中小心翼翼地隐藏了借用”涂尔干承认: “我很感激德国人，但德国对我的真正影响与他所说的完全不同。”。在四天之内，德普罗伊回信明确提到迪尔凯姆所谓欠 Schaeffle、瓦格纳、施莫勒、冯特、西梅尔、拉扎勒斯和斯坦塔尔的债务，而且迪尔凯姆在11月8日的第二封信中不仅详细驳斥了德普罗伊的“错误”、“不准确”和“含沙射影”，而且肯定成为了迪尔凯姆所有作品中最著名的自传段落ーー即。1895年，在“罗伯逊 · 史密斯及其学派的著作”的影响下，他第一次发现了“从社会学角度研究宗教的方法”(1913b: 326)。德普洛伊再次回答; 当他的文章在1911年出版成册时，涂尔干在《安妮社会学》中对其进行了野蛮的评论，再次提到“我们欠罗伯逊 · 史密斯以及英国和美国人种学家的一切”(1913b: 326)

While Durkheim’s autobiographical remarks have led to a productive focus on Durkheim’s British sources, less detailed attention has been granted to the substance of Deploige’s argument. In The Structure of Social Action (1937), for example, Talcott Parsons flatly dismissed Deploige’s suggestion while insisting that Durkheim was the “spiritual heir of Comte,’’ and Steven Lukes has added that while Durkheim “was influenced by these German writers,’’ they simply “clarified and reinforced existing tendencies in his thought’’ (Parsons 1968: 307; Lukes 1972: 92). The historian William Keylor has equally emphasized the Cartesian elements in Durkheim’s thought, and his resulting resistance to German influences (1975: 111 — 15). But in fact, the influence of German social science on Durkheim’s sociological thought was both deep and complex, and must be understood within the institutional and intellectual context already introduced.

虽然涂尔干的自传性评论导致了对涂尔干的英国资料来源的富有成效的关注，但对德普洛伊的论点的实质却没有给予足够的关注。例如，在《社会行动的结构》(1937)一书中，塔尔科特 · 帕森斯断然驳回了德普洛伊奇的建议，坚持认为涂尔干是“伯爵的精神继承人”，史蒂芬 · 卢克斯补充说，虽然涂尔干“受到这些德国作家的影响”，但他们只是“澄清和加强了他的思想中存在的倾向”(帕森斯1968:307; 卢克斯1972:92)。历史学家威廉 · 凯勒(William Keylor)同样强调迪尔凯姆思想中的笛卡尔主义元素，以及由此产生的对德国影响的抵制(1975:111ー15)。但事实上，德国社会科学对涂尔干社会学思想的影响既深刻又复杂，必须在已经介绍过的制度和知识背景下加以理解。

SCIEnTIFIC EDUCATION

科学教育

By the end of the First Empire, Robert Gilpin has observed, the system of scientific education that would persist in France until the end of the Second World War had been firmly established (1968: 86). First, the Revolution swept away the scientific institutions of the ancien regime — e.g., the College Royal, founded in 1530 to supplement the conservative teaching of the Sorbonne, became the College de France; the Jardin des Plantes Medicinales, founded in 1625 for the purpose of cultivating and studying the effects of medicinal herbs, was reconstituted as the Museum d’Histoire Naturelle; and the Academie Royale des Sciences, founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666 for the study of mathematics, physics, and natural history, was suppressed in 1793. The Convention and Napoleon then re-established French higher education under new institutional forms — e.g., the Conservatoire des Arts et Mee tiers, the Ecole Polytechnique, and the Ecole Normale Superieure, all founded in 1794 and reconstituted under the Empire; and the Universite Imperiale, created in 1808 by Napoleon, which brought the previously autonomous, self-governing universities under a central, Parisian administration, simultaneously subdividing them into the ®ve faculties of arts, science, law, theology, and medicine.

罗伯特 · 吉尔平(Robert Gilpin)观察到，到第一帝国结束时，直到第二次世界大战结束，法国一直坚持的科学教育体系已经牢固确立(1968:86)。首先，革命席卷了旧政权的科学机构，例如，1530年为补充 Sorbonne 保守派教学而成立的皇家学院成为法兰西学院，1625年为培育和研究草药作用而成立的巴黎植物园医药学院被重组为自然历史博物馆，以及1666年由让-巴普蒂斯特·柯尔贝尔成立的研究数学、物理和自然历史的皇家科学院在1793年被镇压。大会和拿破仑随后在新的制度形式下重建了法国高等教育，例如，艺术与巴黎综合理工学院学院、高等师范学校学院和三级学院，它们都建立于1794年，并在帝国统治下重建; 以及拿破仑于1808年创建的帝国大学，它将以前自治的自治大学置于巴黎的中央行政管理之下，同时将它们细分为艺术、科学、法律、神学和医学系。

An immediate, positive consequence of this centralization was the migration of French scienti®c talent to the newly created institutions in Paris, resulting in a concentrated, self-conscious, scienti®c elite, and a period of undeniable ± if ephemeral ± brilliance in the history of French science. But for a variety of reasons, this centralized, elitist approach to scienti®c practice either failed to solve traditional problems or created new ones. In any case, the Napoleonic system proved ill-®tted to the future needs for professional scienti®c manpower, and France found itself admiring German models of scienti®c education by the second half of the 19th century. One reason for this failure was that science became increasingly technical and complex, requiring more formal training, greater specialization, and scienti®c professionalization. Institutions like the Academie des sciences and its Napoleonic successor, the Institut de France, which depended upon a small elite of Paris academicians, were simply inadequate to these needs. Complicating this inadequacy was the administrative fragmentation of French science, which subdivided scienti®c intellectual activity among three different sets of institutions — the “grands etablissements scienti®ques,” the university facultes, and the grandes ecoles (Gilpin 1968: 87). The ®rst were research institutions which boasted great scientists (e.g., Georges Cuvier, Andre-Marie Ampere, Marcelin Merthelot), but placed no emphasis on teaching and thus trained few scientists. The university facultes taught science, but were essentially professional schools for the training of medical doctors or teachers for the lycees, and have only recently became centers for research. Of the grandes ecoles, of course, the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Normale Superieure admittedly represented a new type of scienti®c institution — i.e., the ®rst in which science was taught as valuable in itself rather than as auxiliary to some profession. But even the grandes ecoles would fail to meet the demands of the new scienti®c age.

这种中央集权的一个直接的、积极的结果是法国科学人才向巴黎新创建的机构的迁移，导致了一个集中的、自我意识的、科学精英，以及法国科学史上一个不可否认的短暂的、辉煌的时期。但由于种种原因，这种集中的、精英化的科学实践方法要么未能解决传统问题，要么创造了新的问题。无论如何，拿破仑体制已经证明对于未来对专业科学人才的需求是不利的，到19世纪下半叶，法国发现自己开始欣赏德国的科学教育模式。失败的一个原因是科学变得越来越技术化和复杂化，需要更多的正规训练，更多的专业化和科学专业化。像科学院及其拿破仑时代的继任者法兰西学会这样的机构，依赖于巴黎的一小部分精英院士，根本不足以满足这些需求。使这种不足更加复杂的是法国科学的行政分裂，它将科学知识活动细分为三类不同的机构: “大科学机构”、大学教师和大学科学院(Gilpin 1968:87)。第一类是拥有伟大科学家的研究机构(例如乔治 · 居维叶、安德烈-玛丽·安培、马塞林 · 梅塞洛特) ，但不重视教学，因此培养的科学家很少。这所大学的教职员工教授科学，但基本上是培养医生或中学生教师的专业学校，最近才成为研究中心。当然，在大学中，巴黎综合理工学院和高等师范学校代表了一种新型的科学机构ーー也就是说，第一种科学教育本身就是有价值的，而不是作为某种专业的辅助教育。但即使是大学也不能满足新科学时代的要求。

The abolition of the individual French university as a corporate, self-governing entity also left the administration of French higher education divided between two separate, and frequently opposed, levels — the Ministere de l’Instruction Publique and the individual professors. The Ministere had authority over the curriculum, ®nances, and examinations, but its primary concern was with the professional education of secondary teachers (who, in turn, were to prepare students for the State examinations) rather than with the advancement of science. Even had these priorities been reversed, the Ministere could hardly introduce piecemeal reforms without undermining the uniformity essential to the national examination system, and wholesale reforms required re-distribution of resources and thus faced political obstacles. The French professoriat, meanwhile, had inherited a “democratic” system of recruitment which diffused the power of nomination to vacant chairs among the entire faculte rather than granting it to departmental, disciplinary, or university-wide committees. Appropriate to a small faculte, the system had become anachronistic with the increasing size and specialization of higher education, resulting in highly politicized nominations and elections in which professors repeatedly passed judgment on scholars in fields unfamiliar to them (Gilpin 1968: 115—17). In short, the separate universities and academic departments had little authority beyond what they derived from above (the Ministere) or below (the professors).

法国个别大学作为一个法人、自治实体的废除，也使得法国高等教育的管理分为两个独立且经常对立的级别: 公共教学部和个别教授。教育部对课程、国家和考试有权力，但它主要关注的是中学教师的专业教育(反过来，他们又要为学生参加国家考试做准备) ，而不是科学的进步。即使这些优先事项被逆转，该部也很难在不损害国家考试制度所必需的统一性的情况下实行零敲碎打的改革，而大规模的改革需要重新分配资源，因此面临政治障碍。与此同时，这位法国教授继承了一种“民主”的招聘制度，这种制度将提名权分散到整个学院的空缺席位上，而不是授予系、学科或大学范围内的委员会。适合一个小的教师，这个系统已经变得不合时宜，随着高等教育的规模和专业化的增加，导致高度政治化的提名和选举，教授们反复对他们不熟悉的领域的学者进行评判(Gilpin 1968:115-17)。简而言之，独立的大学和学术部门几乎没有权力超越它们来自上级(部长)或下级(教授)的权力。

By sharp contrast, “Germany” — at least until 1860 — was a cultural rather than a political expression; and the 19th-century German universities were thus creatures of the individual states, enjoying a high degree of institutional autonomy, and a long tradition of intense rivalry. Inter-institutional scienti®c competition guaranteed that the Ger man universities would be responsive to the need for new courses, new chairs, new research facilities — to the new science generally (Gilpin 1968: 113—14). The University of Berlin, founded by Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the model for this transformation, re-de®ning the purpose of the university as the advancement of scientific knowledge, replacing the self-taught, virtuoso academic with the specialized scienti®c professional, and providing formal scienti®c training for generations of German scientists. But in the French university, the professor continued to be conceived as a State of®cial whose duty was to transmit a cultural tradition and prepare students for the State examinations: “At the most,” Gilpin summarizes, “research traditionally has been regarded as a privilege extended to professors who have conscientiously performed their primary responsibilities of teaching and examining” (1968: 96—7).

与之形成鲜明对比的是，“德国”——至少在1860年之前——是一种文化而非政治表达; 因此，19世纪的德国大学是各个国家的产物，享有高度的机构自治，并有着激烈竞争的悠久传统。机构间科学竞赛保证了德国大学能够对新课程、新椅子、新研究设施的需求作出反应ーー对新科学的总体需求(Gilpin 1968:113ー14)。由威廉·冯·洪堡创立的柏林大学成为这种转变的典范，重新定义了大学作为科学知识进步的宗旨，用专业化的科学 c 专业人员取代了自学成才的学术大师，并为几代德国科学家提供了正式的科学 c 培训。但是在法国大学里，教授仍然被认为是一种社会状态，其职责是传递文化传统，为学生准备国家考试。“最多,”吉尔平总结道，“研究传统上被视为一种特权，延伸到那些认真履行其主要教学和考试职责的教授身上”(1968:96ー7)。

The Ecole Polytechnique, of course, had been the first institution to introduce the research laboratory into higher education, and in the early part of the century its incomparable facilities attracted eminent scientists like Gaspard Monge, Charles Fourier, and Pierre-Simon LaPlace. But in contrast to the German Technische Hochschule, where students learned the methods of science and became capable of advancing knowledge in their fields, students at the Ecole Polytechnique learned only the content of science and how to apply already existing knowledge (Gilpin 1968: 88-90). The crucial difference between French and German scientific training, Gilpin emphasizes, is that “in Germany it was not enough to know science; one had to be able to do science” (1968: 100). This subordination of research to teaching and of the needs of higher education to those of secondary education was epitomized by the Ecole Normale Superieure, created to train the teachers required by Napoleon’s Universite Imperiale; and it resulted in a French career pattern that routed the aspirant professor through years of teaching in the lycee prior to his accession to the university. In fact, most French scholars spent years teaching at the secondary level, and some remained in the lycees by preference throughout their lives. As the Sens lectures suggest, this pattern provided France with an excellent system of secondary education, but it also meant the loss of promising scholars who might otherwise have become practicing scientists.

当然，巴黎综合理工学院是第一个将研究实验室引入高等教育的机构，在本世纪早期，其无与伦比的设施吸引了著名的科学家，如加斯帕德蒙格，查尔斯傅里叶和皮埃尔-西蒙·拉普拉斯。但是与德国的慕尼黑工业大学相反，德国的学生学习科学方法，并且有能力在他们的领域内提高知识，巴黎综合理工学院的学生只学习科学的内容和如何应用已有的知识(Gilpin 1968:88-90)。吉尔平强调，法国和德国科学训练的关键区别在于，“在德国，仅仅知道科学是不够的; 一个人必须能够做科学”(1968:100)。研究服从于教学，高等教育的需求服从于中等教育的需求，这种高等师范学校体现在为培养拿破仑帝国大学所需要的教师而建立的法国职业模式上，这种模式导致这位有抱负的教授在进入大学之前在中学教书多年。事实上，大多数法国学者花了数年时间在中学教学，有些人一生都在中学教书。正如森斯的讲座所表明的那样，这种模式为法国提供了一个优秀的中等教育体系，但它也意味着失去了本来可以成为实践科学家的有前途的学者。

Nor were there incentives to stimulate other career patterns. The relatively few faculte chairs were spread among general fields such as “zoology” or “physics,” and no one could predict when one would become available. For those who aspired to a university chair, therefore, it was prudent to maintain as broad a competence as possible, and thus to increase the number of one’s options. Nor were new chairs forthcoming. “In a period of static population and a Malthusian fear of overexpansion,’’ Gilpin explains, “very few new chairs were created, and the conservatism of the facultees severely limited the number of existing chairs that were converted from older, effete fields to newer, productive ones’’ (1968: 99). And again, the criteria by which professors were awarded such chairs encouraged them to cultivate their erudition rather than to push boldly against existing orthodoxies. There was also the French national examination system, established in the Napoleonic law of 1808, which gave the State a monopoly in the awarding of academic degrees, and thus the power to control access to the professions. Its purpose was to assure France of a small, uniform, and highly quali®ed elite to administer its centralized institutions; but its effects included rigid study regulations, prescribed curricula, and the diversion of the energies of both students and professors - themselves selected through the same examination process - from the conduct of research to the task of preparation for the examinations.

也没有刺激其他职业模式的激励措施。相对较少的教席分布在一般领域，如“动物学”或“物理学”，没有人能够预测什么时候会有一个。因此，对于那些有志于担任大学校长的人来说，尽可能保持广泛的能力是明智之举，从而增加自己的选择。新的椅子也不会出现。吉尔平解释说: “在一个人口静态和马尔萨斯式的对过度扩张的恐惧的时期，很少有新的椅子被创造出来，教职工的保守主义严重地限制了现有椅子的数量，这些椅子被从旧的、没有生气的领域转换成新的、有生产力的领域。”(1968:99)。同样，授予教授这种座位的标准鼓励他们培养自己的学识，而不是大胆地反对现有的正统观念。还有1808年拿破仑法律规定的法国国家考试制度，该制度赋予国家在授予学位方面的垄断权，从而有权控制进入专业领域的机会。它的目的是确保法国有一个规模小、统一和高素质的精英来管理其中央机构; 但其影响包括严格的学习规定、规定的课程，以及将学生和教授的精力从研究工作转移到准备考试的任务上——他们自己是通过同样的考试过程选拔的。

Compounding these difficulties was the traditional self-image of the French professoriat. “The French idealized the professor as a man of broad culture and encyclopedic knowledge,” Gilpin emphasizes, “rather than as a narrow specialist whose purpose was to make some original contribution to knowledge. He was a savant, steeped in an ancient and classic culture that was to be passed on via his students to the next generation” (1968: 97). This was a tradition, of course, with which Durkheim had little sympathy: “The man of parts, as he once was,” he said in the introduction to De la division du travail social, “is for us no more than a dilettante, and we accord no moral value to dilettantism. Rather, do we perceive perfection in the competent man, one who seeks not to be complete but to be productive, one who has a well-defined job to which he devotes himself, and carries out his task, ploughing his single furrow” (1984: 4).

加剧这些困难的是这位法国教授的传统自我形象。“法国人把教授理想化为一个拥有广博文化和百科知识的人,”吉尔平强调，“而不是一个狭隘的专家，他的目的是为知识做出一些原创性的贡献。他是一个学者，沉浸在一种古老而经典的文化中，这种文化将通过他的学生传递给下一代”(1968:97)。当然，这是一种传统，迪尔凯姆对此并不同情: “一个有着不同部分的人，就像他曾经那样,”他在《社会分工》的序言中说，“对我们来说，他只不过是一个业余爱好者，我们对业余爱好者没有任何道德价值。更确切地说，我们是否在有能力的人身上看到了完美，他不是寻求完整，而是追求生产力，他有一份明确的工作，他全身心地投入其中，完成他的任务，耕耘他的单一犁沟”(1984:4)。

Such objections were increasingly common as the century advanced. Patriotic French scientists like Louis Pasteur begged the government to established research institutions, and the historian Victor Duruy, who, as Ministre de l’Instruction Publique under the Second Empire, had been horrified by the utter uselessness of the classical syllabus to French children, introduced a number of reforms, including the establishment in 1868 of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Zeldin 1977: 248). After 1880, the French government would establish laboratories for industrial research at Nancy, Grenoble, and the Conservatoire National des Arts et Mee tiers, and simultaneously expand the number of engineering schools and institutes, especially in chemistry, electricity, and other rapidly emerging science-based technologies. And by 1896, a reform law would re-group the separate facultes in each city or region into uni®ed institutions. As expressed by Raymond Poincaree , Gilpin observes, the hope was “to introduce into France the autonomous university as it then existed in Germany, which would be a center for uniting teaching and research and for enabling science to contribute to French life” (1968: 93). But none of these reforms, he adds, altered the fundamental structure of French higher education generally, or of scientific education in particular.

随着本世纪的推进，这种反对意见越来越普遍。爱国的法国科学家路易斯 · 巴斯德(Louis Pasteur)恳求政府建立研究机构，历史学家维克多 · 杜鲁伊(Victor Duruy) ，作为第二帝国公共教育部长，对法国儿童完全无用的古典教学大纲感到震惊，提出了一系列改革，包括在1868年建立高等研究应用学院(泽尔丁1977:248)。1880年以后，法国政府将在南希、格勒诺布尔和国家艺术与工程学院建立工业研究实验室，同时扩大工程学院和研究所的数量，特别是在化学、电力和其他迅速兴起的科学技术领域。到了1896年，一项改革法律将每个城市或地区的独立学院重组为联合院校。正如雷蒙德 · 庞加里所说，吉尔平观察到，希望“把当时存在于德国的自治大学引入法国，这将是一个联合教学和研究的中心，并使科学为法国生活做出贡献”(1968:93)。但是，他补充说，这些改革并没有改变法国高等教育，尤其是科学教育的基本结构。

The distinction between higher education in Germany and in France has aptly been characterized as one between the Baconian and Cartesian traditions in the history of science. In the New Atlantis (1624), Bacon had envisioned a day when ordinary men, appropriately trained and organized, would displace the individual genius as producers of scientific progress. This conception was largely realized in the universities and research laboratories of 19th-century Germany, with their focus on a specific scientific problem systematically explored through a highly integrated division of scientific labor. France, by contrast, adhered to the Cartesian image of the individual scientific genius, epitomized in the small, frequently ill equipped and isolated personal laboratory (the laboratoire de chare} attached to professorial appointments, where the professor pursued his personal inclinations with a few poorly trained assistants (Gilpin 1968: 107).

德国高等教育与法国高等教育之间的区别，在科学史上被恰当地描述为培根传统与笛卡尔传统之间的区别。在新亚特兰蒂斯(1624) ，培根设想有一天，普通人，适当的训练和组织，将取代个人的天才作为科学进步的生产者。这一概念在19世纪德国的大学和研究实验室得到了广泛的实现，他们通过高度整合的科学劳动分工系统地探讨了一个具体的科学问题。相比之下，法国坚持笛卡尔式的个人科学天才形象，集中体现在小型、经常设备落后和孤立的个人实验室(附属于教授任命的实验室，在那里，教授与一些训练不足的助手一起追求他的个人爱好(Gilpin 1968:107)。

This French anxiety over the superiority of German scientific education was only increased by the outcome of the Franco-Prussian War. In La Reforme intellectuelle et morale (1872), for example, Ernest Renan observed that the victory of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War was the victory of science. “After Jena,” Renan insisted, “the university of Berlin was the center of the regeneration of Germany. If we wish to rise from our disasters, let us imitate the conduct of Prussia. French intelligence has been weakened; we must strengthen it. Our system of education,” he concluded, “especially of higher education, has need of radical reform” (1872: 55). Renan’s views were widely shared, and they were reflected in that policy of the Ministere de l’Instruction Publique already established by the historian Victor Duruy, of awarding scholarships to the brightest young French agreges so that they might visit Germany to become acquainted with the latest scholarly and scienti®c advances. As we shall see, it was with this support that Durkheim visited the universities of Leipzig, Marburg, and Berlin in 1885—6.

法国人对德国科学教育优越性的焦虑，只是因为普法战争的结果而加剧。例如，欧内斯特 · 雷南在《知识分子与道德的改革》(1872)一书中指出，德国在普法战争上的胜利就是科学的胜利。“在耶拿之后,”雷南坚持说，“柏林大学是德国复兴的中心。如果我们希望从灾难中崛起，就让我们模仿普鲁士的行为吧。法国的情报已经被削弱了，我们必须加强它。我们的教育制度,”他总结道，“特别是高等教育，需要彻底的改革”(1872:55)。雷南的观点得到了广泛的认同，这反映在历史学家维克多 · 杜鲁伊(Victor Duruy)已经制定的公共教学部的政策中，该政策将奖学金颁发给法国最聪明的年轻人，这样他们就可以访问德国，了解最新的学术和科学进展。正如我们将要看到的，正是在这种支持下，涂尔干在1885-1886年访问了莱比锡、马堡和柏林的大学。

DURKHEIM in GERMANY

德国的 DURKHEIM

It was well understood that this German superiority extended to the social as well as the physical sciences. Numerous studies of German higher education and social science had already appeared in the Revue internationale de l'enseignement, the Revue philosophique, and the Journal des economistes; and before Durkheim’s visit, Louis Liard — the devout republican, Renouvierist, and Directeur de l’Instruction Superieure — would encourage him to pay special attention to the state of the social sciences during his stay in Germany, in the hope that they might provide a foundation for the reform of French higher education (Lukes 1972: 95). But as the career of Alfred Espinas (1844-1922) suggests, there were changes taking place in the social sciences within France as well.

众所周知，德国的这种优势延伸到社会科学和自然科学。许多关于德国高等教育和社会科学的研究已经出现在《国际教育杂志》、《哲学杂志》和《经济学家杂志》上; 在涂尔干访问德国之前，虔诚的共和党人、革新主义者、高等教育主任路易斯 · 利亚尔鼓励他在德国期间特别关注社会科学的状况，希望它们能为法国高等教育的改革提供一个基础(卢克斯1972:95)。但正如阿尔弗雷德 · 埃斯皮纳斯(1844-1922)的职业生涯所表明的那样，法国社会科学也发生了变化。

“Can even the near future of [our] country,” Espinas had asked himself in the wake of the Franco-Prussian War, “be predicted with any degree of probability?” To lend itself to prediction, he answered, a society must be “an object of nature, submissive to laws like any other object, an object that could be understood scientifically. Now that requires that social facts be considered in their generality” (1901: 449). Within a year, Espinas had thus conceived the notion of studying animal societies “with the avowed intent to extract from this study some laws that were common to all societies.” Such sociological studies were hardly in vogue: “Neither Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers nor Spencer’s Sociology” Espinas recalled, “had yet appeared. Aside from a few friends with whom Littre had just founded an ephemeral sociological society, there were not ten people in France who were favorable toward this kind of research.'' Four years later, when Les Societes animales (1877) was presented as a doctoral thesis to the Faculty of Letters of the university of Paris, two spiritualist disciples of Cousin - Paul Janet (1823-99) and Emile Caro (1826—87) — both members of the examining committee, greeted it as a vulgar, sociological intrusion into their more literary, abstract, philosophical domain. Though Espinas referred to the possibilities for peaceful coexistence between sociology and ethics, Janet ultimately forced him to suppress the historical introduction to the thesis because he was unwilling to delete a reference to Auguste Comte (1901: 449).

埃斯皮纳斯在普法战争之后问自己: “我们国家即使在不久的将来，也可以用任何可能性来预测吗?”他回答说，为了使自己有助于预测，一个社会必须是“自然的客体，像任何其他客体一样服从于法律，一个可以被科学地理解的客体。”。现在，这要求社会事实被考虑在他们的一般性”(1901:449)。不到一年，埃斯皮纳斯就构思出了研究动物社会的概念，“公开表示要从这项研究中提取出一些对所有社会都普遍适用的规律。”这样的社会学研究并不流行: “谢弗尔的《社会工人的建筑与生活》和斯宾塞的《社会学》都还没有出现,”埃斯皮纳斯回忆说。除了几个朋友，利特尔刚刚建立了一个短暂的社会学社会，在法国没有十个人赞成这种研究。”四年后，当《动物社会》(1877年)作为博士论文提交给巴黎大学文学院时，两位表亲保罗 · 珍妮特(1823-99年)和埃米尔 · 卡罗(1826-87年)的精神学门徒——两位考试委员会的成员——都认为这是对他们更文学、更抽象、更哲学领域的粗俗的社会学侵入。虽然埃斯皮纳斯提到了社会学和伦理学之间的和平共处，但是珍妮特最终还是强迫他压制了这篇论文的历史介绍，因为他不愿意删除提到奥古斯特 · 孔德(1901:449)的部分。

This experience helps us to understand the warmth with which Espinas approached his subject in “Etudes sociologiques en France’’ (1882). “[T]o establish political doctrine firmly on the ground of realities,’’ he explained, “one must take the side of those who admit that sociology is only the continuation and expansion of biology, that human society is a concrete, living thing, of the same order as animal societies’’ (1882: 566—7). Espinas praised Edmond Perrier’s Les Colonies animales (1881) — a “magnificent study of animal morphology'' — for its sociological interpretation of the formative processes of biological organisms, while complaining of the “latent finalism’’ and “vague religiosity” that compromised its otherwise unrelenting scientific determinism (1882: 606). Society is not simply “a sum of juxtaposed individuals,” Espinas embraced Henri Marion’s La Solidarity morale (1880), but “a new being, a true whole, individual in its turn and its way. It is a living body.” Espinas simultaneously criticized Alfred Fouillee (1838±1912) for describing society as “an abstraction' (1882: 342±3). Sociology requires “a complete anatomical study of the diverse parts of the collective organism,” Espinas agreed with the first volume of Albert Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers (1875) ± an analysis “conceived in a whole other spirit from similar studies made among ourselves . . . whose length far surpasses the total attention that the French public grants to these kinds of studies’’ (1882: 351).

这一经历有助于我们理解埃斯皮纳斯在《法国社会学研究》(1882)中对待自己主题的热情。他解释说: “为了在现实的基础上牢固地建立政治学说，我们必须站在那些承认社会学只是生物学的延续和扩展，人类社会是一个具体的、有生命的东西，与动物社会的秩序相同的人的一边。”(1882:566ー7)。埃斯皮纳斯赞扬了埃德蒙 · 佩里埃的《群居动物》(1881)ーー一部“对动物形态学的杰出研究”ーー对生物有机体形成过程的社会学解释，同时抱怨“潜在的终结论”和“模糊的宗教信仰”损害了其原本坚定不移的科学决定论(1882:606)。社会不仅仅是“一个并列的个体的总和”，埃斯皮纳斯欣然接受了亨利 · 马里昂的《团结工会》(1880) ，而是“一个新的存在，一个真正的整体，一个按照自己的方式发展的个体。它是一个有生命的躯体。”埃斯皮纳斯同时批评阿尔弗雷德 · 福利(1838 ± 1912)将社会描述为“一种抽象”(1882:342 ± 3)。社会学要求“对集体有机体的不同部分进行完整的解剖学研究”，埃斯皮纳斯同意阿尔伯特 · 谢弗尔(Albert Schaeffle)的《社会科学的保证与生存》(Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers，1875) ± 第一卷中的一项分析，“从我们之间进行的类似研究中，以一种完全不同的精神构思出来... ... 它的长度远远超过法国公众对这类研究的全部关注”(1882:351)。

By August, 1883, these views had brought Espinas into conflict with Boutroux as well as Janet and Caro. Boutroux could observe that, while the philosophy journals still published articles on Plato, Descartes, Malebranche and Spinoza, these were increasingly accompanied by studies of “the speed of neural transmission, the theory of reflexes, cerebral irritability, Darwinism, space in n dimensions, problems of the nervous system, animal colonies, sociology, ethology, and ethnography” (1883: 865). But despite this convergence of philosophy with the positive sciences, the content of the philosophy concours d’agregation ± the annual competitive examination required for appointment to a teaching position in a lycee ± had remained the same. Boutroux thus asked if the time had not come for a thorough revision of the concours, which would establish greater harmony between the current state of philosophy and the progress of the positive sciences. His answer ± which helps us to appreciate the significance of Durkheim’s later claim, in L’Evolution pedagogique and L’Education morale, that the study of science could be “morally edifying’’ ± was entirely negative: “[W]e need not be troubled,’’ he observed, “by the view of the divergence which exists between the agregation and contemporary philosophy. This divergence lies in the nature of things. The goal of the agregation is not to show that young people are au courant with the most recent hypotheses of science. It has its own distinct ®eld, which is that of subjective, moral philosophy’’ (1883: 873).

到了1883年8月，这些观点使埃斯皮纳斯与布特鲁克斯以及珍妮特和卡罗发生了冲突。布特鲁克斯可以观察到，虽然哲学杂志仍然发表关于柏拉图、笛卡尔、马尔布兰奇和斯宾诺莎的文章，但这些文章越来越多地伴随着对“神经传递速度、反射理论、大脑敏感性、达尔文主义、 n 维空间、神经系统问题、动物群体、社会学、行为学和人种学”(1883:865)的研究。但是，尽管哲学与实证科学的这种趋同，哲学的内容聚合在一起 ± 年度竞争性考试的任命所需的教师职位在大学生 ± 保持不变。因此，布特鲁克斯问，是否到了彻底修订大赛的时候了，这将在哲学的现状与实证科学的进步之间建立更大的和谐。他的回答有助于我们理解涂尔干后来在《进化教育学》和《教育士气》中提出的关于科学研究可以“道德熏陶”的观点的重要性。他的回答完全是消极的: “(我们)不必为总体和当代哲学之间存在的分歧感到困扰,”他说。这种分歧在于事物的本质。汇总的目的不是要表明年轻人熟悉最新的科学假设。它有自己独特的领域，这是主观的，道德哲学”(1883:873)。

Not surprisingly, Espinas disagreed. “In reality,’’ he responded, “it’s a question of knowing if philosophy instruction as created in France by Cousin ought to stay as it is, or even if it ought to stay at all’’ (1884: 586). The question raised by Boutroux, Espinas added, is only one episode of the grand struggle that engages, at this time, in every civilized country, and on every point of curricula, two opposed systems of culture ± one which sets out to develop the mind by exercising it in a

毫不奇怪，埃斯皮纳斯不同意。“实际上,”他回答说，“这是一个问题，要弄清楚表哥在法国创造的哲学教学是否应该保持现状，或者甚至是否应该保持现状。”(1884:586)。埃斯皮纳斯补充说，布特鲁克斯提出的问题只是当前每个文明国家都在进行的伟大斗争中的一个片段，在课程的每一个方面，都存在着两种截然相反的文化体系 ± 1，这种体系旨在通过在一个文明社会中锻炼思想来发展思想

vacuum, on itself, by pure gymnastics; and another which wants to join to these formal exercises a substantial diet drawn from the spectacle of things. (1884: 607)

而另一个想要加入这些正式练习的人，则是从这些奇观中汲取大量营养。(1884:607)

Among the “things” thus to be observed, of course, were consciences sociales, the collective realities created through the fusion of individual minds that Espinas had described in Les Societes animales: “They exist for themselves, and must thus be counted among the highest of realities . . . The individual is thus the product far more than the author of society.” Society, he added, “is a concrete living thing’’ (1978: 540, 542)-

当然，在这些需要观察的“事物”中，有社会意识，即埃斯皮纳斯在《社会动物》(Les Societe)中描述的通过融合个体思维而创造的集体现实: “它们为自己而存在，因此必须被视为最高现实之一... ... 因此，个体是社会的产物，远远超过社会的创造者。”他补充说，社会“是一个具体的生命体”(1978:540,542)-

Even before his departure, Durkheim had already developed interests similar to those of Espinas and Perrier, and gone beyond them in significant ways. In his 1885 review of the first volume of of Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers, for example, Durkheim noted that despite the discussion of Schaeffle’s work by Espinas and Fouillee, the German author remained “very little discussed’’ — a fact which he thought made his own review “tardy but timely.’’ Schaeffle, Durkheim emphasized, “is clearly a realist. Society is not a simple collection of individuals, it is an entity which preceded those who comprise it at present and which will survive them, which acts more on them than they on it, which has its own life, own consciousness, own interests and destiny’’ (1885a: 93). But where writers like Espinas had emphasized the biological foundations of human societies, Schaeffle insisted that the relationship between organisms and societies was purely metaphorical. “[T]he members of human societies are not attached to one another by a material link,’’ Durkheim observed, “but by ideal bonds’’ — a distinction that affirmed Espinas’ insistence on the reality of social phenomena while simultaneously asserting the independence of sociology from biology (1885a: 94—5, 110—11). Finally, the earliest hint of Durkheim’s dissatisfaction with the Cartesian vocabulary of idees claires et simples — so clear in L'Evolution pedagogique and L'Education morale — received expression in his review of Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben. “[T]here are few readings more highly instructive for a Frenchman,’’ he concluded, for it is “by the practice of such patient and laborious studies that we shall fortify our spirit, now too slender, too thin, too fond of simplicity. It is by learning to face the infinite complexity of facts that we free ourselves of those too narrow frameworks in which we tend to compartmentalize things. It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that the future worth of French sociology depends on this’’ (1885a: 110).

甚至在他离开之前，迪尔凯姆就已经形成了类似于 Espinas 和巴黎水的兴趣，并且在很大程度上超越了这些兴趣。例如，迪尔凯姆在1885年对谢弗勒的《社会工作者的工作与生活》(Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers)第一卷的评论中指出，尽管埃斯皮纳斯(Espinas)和傅利(Fouillee)对谢弗勒的作品进行了讨论，但这位德国作家仍然“很少被讨论”——他认为这一事实使他自己的评论“迟到但及时”涂尔干强调，谢弗“显然是一个现实主义者。社会不是一个简单的个体的集合，它是一个实体，它先于那些现在组成它的人，并将在他们生存下来，它对他们的作用多于对它的作用，它有自己的生命、自己的意识、自己的利益和命运”(1885a: 93)。但是像 Espinas 这样的作家强调人类社会的生物学基础，Schaeffle 坚持认为有机体和社会之间的关系是纯粹的隐喻。迪尔凯姆观察到: “人类社会的成员之间不是通过物质联系相连，而是通过理想的纽带相连。”这一区别肯定了埃斯皮纳斯对社会现象现实的坚持，同时也肯定了社会学与生物学的独立性(1885a: 94ー5,110ー11)。最后，迪尔凯姆对笛卡尔的思想词汇不满的最早迹象——在《进化论》的教育学和《教育士气》中如此清晰——在他对谢弗尔的《建筑与生活》的评论中得到了体现。他总结道: “对于一个法国人来说，没有什么读物能比这更有教育意义了，正是通过这种耐心和艰苦的学习实践，我们才能强化我们的精神，现在我们太瘦了，太瘦了，太喜欢简单了。”。正是通过学会面对事实的无限复杂性，我们才能从那些过于狭隘的框架中解脱出来，在这些框架中，我们倾向于将事物分割开来。可以毫不夸张地说，法国社会学的未来价值取决于此”(1885a: 110)。

Similarly, in the first paragraph of his review of Ludwig Gumplo-wicz’s Grundriss der Soziologie (1885), Durkheim suggested that the work was further evidence of the German effort to advance sociological studies in every possible direction. “How regrettable it is,’’ he added, that “this interesting movement is so little known and so little followed in France. So it is that sociology, French in origin, becomes more and more a German science.’’[63](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark75) The same review complained again of the insufficient and erroneous treatment given to Schaeffie’s discussion of the relationship between sociology and biology. Again, Durkheim’s 1885(b) review of Fouillee’s La Propriete sociale et la democratie (1884) complained that Schaeffie’s views on socialism had been completely misunderstood (1885b: 451-2). And still again, Durkheim’s 1886 review of Schaeffie’s Die Quintessenz des Sozialismus (1885) objected to the treatment rendered that work by the liberal economist Paul Leroy-Beaulieu (1843—1916) (1886a: 76—7).

同样，在他对路德维希 · 冈普洛-维奇的《社会学基础》(Grundriss der Soziologie，1885)的评论的第一段中，涂尔干提出，这项工作进一步证明了德国在各个可能的方向上推进社会学研究的努力。“这是多么令人遗憾,”他补充说，“这个有趣的运动在法国如此鲜为人知，如此鲜有人效仿。因此，起源于法国的社会学，越来越成为一门德国科学。”63同样的评论再次抱怨对谢菲关于社会学和生物学之间关系的讨论给予的不充分和错误的处理。同样，涂尔干在1885年(b)对傅利的《社会主义与民主》(1884)的评论中抱怨说，谢菲的社会主义观点被完全误解了(1885年 b: 451-2)。同样，迪尔凯姆在1886年对谢菲的《社会主义精英集》(Die Quintessenz des Sozialism，1885)的评论反对自由主义经济学家保罗 · 勒罗伊-比尤利厄(Paul Leroy-Beaulieu，1843ー1916)(1886a: 76ー7)的论述。

But if Durkheim was thus interested in German social science in general — and that of the “realist’’ Schaeffie in particular — he was not yet the social realist of L’Evolution pedagogique and L’Education morale. This is especially evident in the review of Gumplowicz: “Societies are described to us as simple, indivisible forces,’’ Durkheim there observed, “which drive and impel violently before them the individuals of which they are composed. But is this not to admit a social principle strongly analogous to the old vitalist principle, albeit still less scientific?’’ Durkheim asked rhetorically. The answer was clear: “No doubt a society is a being, a person,’’ he observed, but “this being has nothing metaphysical about it. It is not some more or less transcendent substance.’’ On the contrary, it is a whole composed of parts, and the problem for sociology is to “break up the whole, to enumerate these parts, to describe and classify them, and to ®nd out how they are grouped and divided’’ — precisely the “great service . . . rendered to science’’ by the first volume of Schaeffie’s Bau und Leben. In society, Durkheim concluded, “there are only individuals, it is individuals and individuals alone that are the factors of social life’’ (1885c: 632).

但是，如果涂尔干因此对德国社会科学感兴趣，特别是对“现实主义者”谢菲的社会科学感兴趣，那么他还不是“进化教育学”和“教育士气”的社会现实主义者。这一点在《 Gumplowicz 》的评论中尤为明显: “社会被描述为简单的、不可分割的力量,”迪尔凯姆在评论中说，“这些力量在它们面前以暴力驱使着由它们组成的个体。但是，这难道不是承认一个与旧的生命力主义原则非常相似的社会原则，尽管它的科学性更低吗?”涂尔干反问道。答案很清楚: “毫无疑问，一个社会是一个存在，一个人,”他说，但“这个存在没有任何形而上学的东西。它不是某种或多或少的超然物质。”相反，它是一个由部分组成的整体，社会学面临的问题是“打破整体，列举这些部分，描述和分类它们，并找出它们是如何分组和划分的”——这正是谢菲的《建筑与生活》(Bau und Leben)第一卷中所说的“为科学... ... 提供的伟大服务”。在社会中，涂尔干总结道，“只有个体，只有个体和个体才是社会生活的因素”(1885c: 632)。

The immediate consequences of Durkheim’s visit to Germany were two essays: “L’Enseignement de la philosophie dans les universites allemandes,” which appeared in the Revue internationale de l'enseignement in 1887, and “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne,” which appeared in the Revue philosophique the same year. The second essay contained a detailed treatment of a variety of German social scientists, and is best treated in the larger context of German romanticism; but the first dealt directly with the conditions of German higher education, particularly as they existed in the philosophy faculty at the University of Leipzig. Durkheim envied the administrative decentralization and intellectual autonomy of the German universities, but considered the resulting multiplication of overlapping, ill-attended courses a “luxury without great profits,” and suggested that “a little French centralization” and division of intellectual labor would be “all to the good” (1887a: 315-18). Again, he acknowledged the flexibility of the German privatdozent system, particularly when compared with “the rigidity of our [French] administrative organization''; but he added that the sacri®ces required of a privatdozent discouraged many promising scholars, and threatened to create an intellectual proletariat of those who were not. In any case, Durkheim insisted, these supernumerary instructors are required by the almost absolute separation of the German gymnasium and the university, and the infrequency with which one rises from the first to the second; but it is precisely in the lycees, he reminded his audience, that the facultes regenerate themselves, rendering a system of privatdozents inapplicable to the French case (1887a: 318-20).

迪尔凯姆访问德国的直接结果是两篇文章: 《德国大学的哲学教育》 ，1887年出现在《德国国际教育杂志》上; 《德国道德的积极科学》 ，同年出现在《德国哲学杂志》上。第二篇文章详细论述了德国社会科学家的各种情况，最好是在德国浪漫主义的大背景下论述，但第一篇文章直接论述了德国高等教育的状况，尤其是在莱比锡大学的哲学系。涂尔干羡慕德国大学的行政地方分权和知识自主权，但认为由此产生的重叠课程的增加是“没有巨大利润的奢侈品”，并建议“一点法国中央集权”和知识分工将是“所有的好”(1887a: 315-18)。他再次承认了德国私人签证制度的灵活性，尤其是与“我们(法国)行政机构的僵化”相比; 但他补充说，对私人签证所要求的牺牲让许多有前途的学者望而却步，并威胁要创造一个知识分子无产阶级。无论如何，涂尔干坚持认为，德国的体育馆和大学几乎是绝对分开的，而且从第一所大学升到第二所大学的频率很低，这就需要这些额外的教师。但是，他提醒他的听众，正是在中学里，学院的教师才能重生，使得私人教师制度不适用于法国的情况(1887a: 318-20)。

As for the nature of philosophical instruction itself, Durkheim again found the Germans wanting. Though no admirer of an inflated oratorical style, for example, Durkheim found the contrary fault -i.e., “the disdain for oratorical form to the point of literally dictating their lectures” (1887a: 320) — more common. The virtual absence of philosophy in the gymnasium, moreover, meant that philosophical teaching in the university had to be “very elementary and very general,” something Durkheim regarded as “a danger for German philosophy — that is to say, for one of the greatest, most uncontested glories of Germany” (1887a: 325—6). Once enclosed within their specialities, however, German students exhibited a total disinterest in other subjects, and in public affairs generally, a narrowing of focus Durkheim attributed to the lamentable, practical concern for fees of inscription and examinations. There were at least three aspects of philosophy teaching in the German universities, however, which Durkheim could not help but admire. The ®rst was the tendency he perceived to increase the philosophy requirements for future professors of secondary education. “It is truly curious,” Durkheim observed, “that, at the moment where our rivals recognize the advantages of our organization on this point, we, on the contrary, have begun to doubt it, and are tempted to adopt a system which they are on the point of wanting no longer” (1887a: 426—7). Here Durkheim was apparently referring, not to the quarrel between Boutroux and Espinas over the philosophy agregation, but to the efforts of the historian Gustave Monod and the psychologist Theo-dule Ribot to replace the teaching of philosophy in the lycees altogether with that of newer, rival disciplines; and here, Durkheim still seems to have sided with the spiritualist defenders of the classe de philosophie: “Let us piously conserve the life where we have the happiness to encounter it,” he insisted, “and leave philosophy in our lycees since it is living there” (1887a: 439). In particular, Durkheim was critical of the efforts of Ernest Lavisse, a disciple of Duruy and an expert on German history, on behalf of the teaching of history in the lycees. “Lavisse has told us,” Durkheim observed, “how history can and must serve the national education . . . [But for better or worse, we no longer have the spirit of tradition, and our incorrigible rationalism is only slightly accessible to historical arguments . . . It is still to the professor of philosophy,” Durkheim thus concluded, “that it belongs to awake among the minds which are conhded to him the idea of what a law is, and to make them understand that psychic and social phenomena are facts like any others, submitted to laws which the human will cannot disturb at its pleasure” (1887a: 439—40). As W. W. Miller has recently emphasized, for Durkheim social facts are thus “will-independent” even where they are “mind-dependent” (1996: 47).

至于哲学教学本身的性质，涂尔干再次发现德国人缺乏。尽管没有人崇拜夸张的演讲风格，例如，涂尔干发现了相反的错误——即“对演讲形式的蔑视，以至于直接口述他们的演讲”(1887a: 320)——更为常见。此外，体育馆里几乎没有哲学，这意味着大学里的哲学教学必须“非常基础和非常普遍”，涂尔干认为这是“对德国哲学的危险ーー也就是说，对德国最伟大、最无可争议的荣耀之一”(1887a: 325ー6)。然而，一旦被封闭在他们的专业之内，德国学生对其他学科和公共事务表现出完全的漠不关心，迪尔凯姆将焦点缩小归因于对铭文和考试费用的可悲的、实际的关注。然而，德国大学的哲学教学至少有三个方面，这是迪尔凯姆不得不佩服的。第一个趋势是他认为增加对未来中等教育教授的哲学要求。涂尔干说: “真是奇怪，当我们的竞争对手认识到我们组织在这一点上的优势时，恰恰相反，我们开始怀疑这一点，并试图采用一种他们不再想要的体系。”。涂尔干显然指的不是布特鲁克斯和埃斯皮纳斯之间关于哲学集合的争论，而是历史学家古斯塔夫 · 莫诺德(Gustave Monod)和心理学家西奥-杜勒 · 里伯特(Theo-dule Ribot)试图用新的竞争学科取代中学哲学教学的努力; 在这里，涂尔干似乎仍然站在哲学课的唯心主义捍卫者一边: “让我们虔诚地保存我们有幸遇到它的生活,”他坚持说，“把哲学留在我们的中学里，因为它就生活在那里”(1887a: 439)。涂尔干特别批评了欧内斯特 · 拉维斯(Duruy 的门徒，德国历史专家)在中学历史教学方面的努力。涂尔干评论道: “拉维斯告诉我们，历史如何能够而且必须为国民教育服务... ... (但无论是好是坏，我们不再具备传统精神，我们无可救药的理性主义只能在历史论证中略微体现出来... ... 哲学教授仍然能够做到这一点,”涂尔干由此得出结论，“它属于那些被赋予法律概念的思想中的觉醒者，让他们明白，精神和社会现象与其他任何现象一样，都是事实，服从于人类不能随意扰乱的法律”(1887a: 439-40)。正如 W · W · 米勒最近强调的那样，涂尔干的社会事实因此是“意志独立的”，即使它们是“思想依赖的”(1996:47)。

The second thing Durkheim admired about the German philosophical environment were the various sections of the Akademische-philosophische Verein, groups of 15—20 young people who met on Thursday evenings and Sunday afternoons “to talk about philosophy, with much seriousness no doubt, but without pedantry,'' and remained afterward to laugh and drink in “der Gemutliche Teil der Sitzung.'' In spite of their academic character, Durkheim observed, these meetings gave rise to personal relationships and a “corporative spirit” well adapted to the French national character (1887a: 436). Durkheim’s concerns here were not trivial. On the contrary, his admiration for the Akademische-philosophische Verein was an inseparable part of his life-long repugnance for excessive individualism, and his desire to restore the corporate spirit destroyed by the Revolution. He insisted:

涂尔干羡慕德国哲学环境的第二件事，是学术哲学协会的各个部分。该协会由15至20名年轻人组成，他们在周四晚上和周日下午聚在一起，“毫无疑问，非常严肃地谈论哲学，但不迂腐”，之后在“德国哲学协会的部分会议”(der Gemutliche Teil der Sitzung)上大笑和喝酒涂尔干注意到，尽管这些会议具有学术性质，但它们产生了人际关系和一种与法国民族性格相适应的“团体精神”(1887a: 436)。涂尔干在这里的担忧不是无关紧要的。恰恰相反，他对学院派哲学家协会的钦佩，是他一生对过度个人主义的反感和恢复被革命摧毁的企业精神的渴望不可分割的一部分。他坚称:

In spite of the rivalry of the professors, in spite of the excessive feeling that each of them has of his own independence, in spite of the radical separation of studies, when one has penetrated into the university one feels at the heart of a whole in which all of the parts conspire, even if one cannot see clearly toward what end. A certain number of collective sentiments, bequeathed by tradition, make this enormous mass of instructors and students move by common accord.

尽管教授们彼此竞争，尽管教授们过分地认为他们每个人都有自己的独立性，尽管学科之间存在根本的分离，但当一个人进入大学，就会感到自己处于一个整体的中心，各个部分在其中共谋，即使不能清楚地看到最终的结果。传统遗留下来的一定数量的集体情感，使这一庞大的教师群体和学生们协调一致地行动起来。

The German student, he added, does not feel the “unhealthy need which drives us to distinguish ourselves, and consequently to isolate ourselves, from one another” - indeed, the words “distinctiveness” and “originality” are almost untranslatable into German. These tastes, aptitudes, and inclinations for the corporative life “cannot be easily transplanted into France . . . [for] each of us has too much feeling for his own personality to voluntarily abandon it. Yet it is hardly contestable,” Durkheim concluded, “that what we have the most need of at this moment is the revival within us of the taste for collective life. What is this entire succession of reforms which have just resuscitated our higher education, if not a long and laborious effort of concentration?” (1887a: 436—7).

他补充说，这位德国学生并没有感受到“驱使我们区分自己，从而孤立自己的不健康需求”——实际上，“独特性”和“原创性”这些词几乎无法翻译成德语。这些品味、才能和对企业生活的兴趣“不能轻易移植到法国... ... 因为我们每个人对自己的个性都有太多的感受，不能自愿放弃。然而，“涂尔干总结说,”我们现在最需要的是我们内心对集体生活品味的复兴，这一点几乎是无可争议的。如果不是长期而艰苦的集中努力，那么这一系列刚刚使我们的高等教育复苏的改革又是什么呢?”(1887a: 436ー7)。

The third feature of the German philosophical environment which captured Durkheim's imagination was the seminar and laboratory of Wilhelm Wundt. To understand the nature of this attraction, however, requires a grasp of the historical development of the social sciences in Germany in the 19th century, and of their foundation in the German romantic movement.

德国哲学环境的第三个特点是威廉 · 冯特的研讨会和实验室，这一特点抓住了涂尔干的想象力。然而，要理解这种吸引力的本质，就需要掌握19世纪德国社会科学的历史发展，以及它们在德国浪漫主义运动中的基础。

THE POSITIVE SCIEnCE OF ETHICS in GERMANY

德国的实证伦理学

In the century following the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the Germans had been the least nationally minded of all European peoples. The microscopic German states of the Holy Roman Empire had no perceptible common border, and the area of German speech simply faded out as one approached Alsace, the Austrian Netherlands, Poland, Bohemia, or the upper Balkans. Priding themselves on a more cosmopolitan outlook, the upper classes became contemptuous of much that was German and, in particular, adopted French fashions, dress, etiquette, manners, ideas, and language. At Potsdam, Frederick the Great befriended Voltaire, wrote his own books in French, and even hired French tax collectors.

在威斯特伐利亚和约之后的一个世纪(1648年) ，德国人一直是所有欧洲人中最没有民族意识的。神圣罗马帝国的微观德意志国家没有可感知的共同边界，当人们接近 Alsace、奥地利、荷兰、波兰、波希米亚或上巴尔干地区时，德语区域就消失了。上层阶级为自己的世界观感到自豪，他们对德国的很多东西都不屑一顾，尤其是采用了法国的时尚、服饰、礼仪、礼仪、思想和语言。在波茨坦，腓特烈二世们与伏尔泰成了朋友，用法语写了自己的书，甚至还雇佣了法国的税吏。

An initial sign of the precariousness of this cosmopolitanism was the appearance of Johann Gottfried von Herder's Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit (1784—91). A Protestant pastor and theologian who considered the French frivolous and affected, Herder felt that the imitation of foreign customs made people shallow and artificial. All true culture or civilization, he argued, must arise from native soil, and especially from the Volk or common people, which possessed its own genius or Volksgeist. This conception of the Volksgeist rebelled not only against the French, but against that entire pattern of thought which had characterized the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, the identity of human nature, the universal rights of man, the timeless principles of natural law, and the classical rules of aesthetic judgment. For these Enlightenment ideas, Herder and his followers now increasingly substituted those of intuition, the diversity of human nature, the social and historical origins of particular rights and laws, and the peculiar genius represented by the art of each particular people.

这种世界主义的危险性的一个初步迹象是约翰·哥特弗雷德·赫尔德的《人类历史哲学思想》(1784-91)的出现。赫尔德是一位新教牧师和神学家，他认为法国人是轻浮和感情用事的，他认为模仿外国习俗使人们变得肤浅和虚伪。他认为，所有真正的文化或文明都必须产生于本土，特别是产生于拥有自己的天赋或人民精神的民众或普通人。这种民众精神的概念不仅反对法国，而且反对启蒙运动的整个思维模式，这种思维模式强调理性、人性的认同、人的普遍权利、自然法的永恒原则以及审美判断的古典规则。对于这些启蒙思想，赫尔德和他的追随者们现在越来越多地用直觉、人性的多样性、特定权利和法律的社会和历史渊源以及每个特定民族的艺术所代表的独特天赋来代替它们。

This initial form of “nationalism” was largely cultural; but with the Revolution and the rise of the Napoleonic Empire, it acquired increasingly democratic and political overtones. The Revolution, by showing how a people could raise themselves to the dignity of citizenship and participate in the affairs of their country, made the Germans acutely conscious of their own politically retarded condition; and the Empire, by conquering Germany and establishing France as the greatest power in Europe, deepened their humiliation still further. Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762 — 1814), an early admirer of Rousseau, the Revolution, and the Republic, reversed himself when Napoleon conquered Germany, embracing Herder's idea of the Volksgeist in its most passionate form. There is a primordial, immutable German spirit, Fichte insisted in his Reden an die deutsche Nation (1808), more noble than that of other peoples, from whom its purity must thus be protected. Germans, in short, became preoccupied with ideas of political unity and national greatness, precisely because they had neither; and this preoccupation found a ready outlet in the social sciences which grew rapidly under the aegis of its secular, autonomous universities.

这种“民族主义”的最初形式主要是文化上的，但随着革命和法兰西第一帝国的兴起，它获得了越来越多的民主和政治色彩。通过展示一个民族如何提升自己的公民尊严和参与国家事务，这场革命让德国人敏锐地意识到他们自己在政治上的迟钝; 帝国通过征服德国和建立法国作为欧洲最强大的国家，进一步加深了他们的屈辱。约翰·戈特利布·费希特(1762-1814) ，卢梭、革命和共和国的早期崇拜者，在拿破仑征服德国时改变了自己，以最激情的形式接受了赫尔德的人民思想。费希特在他的《德意志民族》(1808)一书中坚持认为，有一种原始的、不可改变的德国精神，它比其他民族的精神更高尚，因此必须保护它的纯洁。简而言之，德国人之所以对政治团结和国家伟大的理念念念不忘，正是因为他们两者都没有; 而这种念头在社会科学领域找到了一个现成的出口，在世俗的自治大学的庇护下，社会科学迅速发展起来。

Introducing his 1887 essay on “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne,” Durkheim noted that the science of ethics had not begun among moral philosophers at all, but rather “among the jurists and above all among the economists. It is in political economy,” he insisted, “that the entire movement began” (1887b: 34). The seminal figure here was Adam Heinrich Muller (1779—1829), the intellectual spokesman for the reactionary forces of post-Napoleonic Prussia who epitomized both the cultural and political dimensions of the German romantic movement in the social sciences. Born in Berlin, Muller studied at Berlin and Gottingen before moving to Vienna in 1802, where he became a friend of the politician and economist Friedrich von Gentz, and captured the attention of Metternich. In Dresden (1806—9), Muller joined with the romantic dramatist Heinrich von Kleist in editing Phobus, and upon returning to Vienna and joining the Austrian government service, he became associated with the emerging school of “romantic political economists,” including Gentz, Karl Ludwig von Haller, Johann Joseph von Gorres and Franz von Baader. All were deeply influenced by Fichte, and opposed the cold rationality, individualism, and emphasis on material values characteristic of 18th-century political economy. Deeply inspired by the more “integrated” social organization of the Middle Ages, they sought to develop a political economy based on an organic conception of society, and thus to recapture the “German spirit.”

迪尔凯姆在介绍他1887年的论文《德国道德的积极科学》时指出，伦理学根本不是从道德哲学家开始的，而是从“法学家，尤其是经济学家”开始的。正是在政治经济学中,”他坚持说，“整个运动开始了”(1887b: 34)。这里的开创性人物是亚当 · 海因里希 · 穆勒(Adam Heinrich Muller，1779-1829) ，他是后拿破仑时代普鲁士反动势力的知识分子代言人，是德国社会科学浪漫主义运动的文化和政治维度的缩影。穆勒出生于柏林，曾在柏林和 Gottingen 学习，1802年移居维也纳，在那里他成为了政治家和经济学家弗里德里希•冯根茨(Friedrich von Gentz)的朋友，并引起了梅特涅的注意。在德累斯顿(1806-1809) ，穆勒加入了浪漫主义剧作家的海因里希·冯·克莱斯特，编辑《福布斯》 ，回到维也纳并加入奥地利政府部门后，他与新兴的“浪漫主义政治经济学家”学派建立了联系，包括根茨、卡尔 · 路德维希 · 冯 · 哈勒、约翰 · 约瑟夫 · 冯 · 戈雷斯和弗朗茨 · 冯 · 巴德尔。他们都深受费希特的影响，反对冷理性、个人主义和强调18世纪政治经济的物质价值观。他们深受中世纪更为“一体化”的社会组织的启发，寻求发展基于有机社会观念的政治经济，从而重拾“德国精神”

These features are particularly evident in Muller's Die Elemente der Staatskunste (1809), based upon lectures he had given at Dresden. Here Muller suggested that political, economic, religious, moral, and aesthetic elements be indivisibly merged in the German state, which would thus represent “the mysterious reciprocity of all the relationships of life.'' The economic aspect of society, Muller thus argued, could not be separated from these other elements, but rather had to be studied as but one part of an organic unity. The classical, 18th-century concept of wealth, for example, was rejected in favor of Muller's conception of “spiritual capital,” including not only material objects, but also the less tangible traditions of the nation's past, its constitution, its language, the motivations and character of its people, its distinctive forms of knowledge and technology — in short, all the nonmaterial features of the society's culture (Bowen I968: 522).

这些特征在穆勒的《国家元素》(1809)中尤为明显，这本书是根据他在德累斯顿的演讲改编的。在这里，穆勒提出，政治、经济、宗教、道德和审美元素在德国国家中不可分割地融合在一起，从而代表了“所有生活关系的神秘互惠”因此，穆勒认为，社会的经济方面不能与这些其他要素分开，而是必须作为有机统一体的一部分来研究。例如，18世纪经典的财富概念遭到拒绝，因为穆勒的“精神资本”概念不仅包括物质对象，还包括国家过去的非实体传统、宪法、语言、人民的动机和性格、独特的知识和技术形式ーー简而言之，社会文化的所有非物质特征(Bowen I968:522)。

Muu ller's influence on his contemporaries was limited, but his ideas eventually found expression in the works of Georg Friedrich List (1789-1846) who, visiting the United States in 1825, had been deeply impressed by the “economic nationalism” exhibited there — i.e., high tariffs established to protect nascent, domestic manufacturers from competition from British imports. The classical doctrine of free trade, List realized, was less a system of absolute economic truths than a doctrine suited to the interests of 18th-century British industry, which would reduce other countries to the role of supplying raw materials in return for British exports. This was a Guterwelt, List insisted, a non-existent world of abstractions in which the competition between individual economic interests, everywhere the same, would be resolved through the working out of ineluctable economic laws.

穆勒对同时代人的影响有限，但他的思想最终在弗里德里希·李斯特(1789-1846)的作品中得到了体现。1825年，穆勒访问美国时，美国展现出的“经济民族主义”给他留下了深刻的印象，即为保护新生的国内制造商免受英国进口产品的竞争而设立的高关税。李斯特意识到，经典的自由贸易学说与其说是一种绝对经济真理体系，不如说是一种符合18世纪英国工业利益的学说，这种学说将使其他国家沦为提供原材料以换取英国出口的角色。李斯特坚持认为，这是一个古特韦尔特(Guterwelt)的世界，一个不存在的抽象世界，在这个世界里，无论在哪里，个体经济利益之间的竞争都将通过制定不可避免的经济规律来解决。

For this abstract, unreal world contrived by British political economy, List substituted the economic realities of specific societies, in which material interests were inextricably related to all other aspects of the culture, including language, literature, and history. Particularly in Das nationale System der politischen Okonomie (1841), List insisted that economic laws vary from one society to another, that individual interests are always pursued in a social context conditioned by a variety of social institutions, and called for a “national economy” controlled and directed by the German state, whose policies would be based upon the empirical observation of German realities — and, at least temporarily, would include economic protectionism. List's particular version of the Volksgeist, Durkheim would write in 1903, “is undoubtedly an obscure, mystical idea, and the very definition of a national economy rules out the possibility of truly scientific laws, since its object is conceived as unique, thereby excluding comparisons.” But List had made an important advance, Durkheim immediately added, “by introducing into economic speculation the idea that society has a real existence, and that the manifestations of its own life comprise relationships interacting with economic phenomena” (1982: 197—8). This insight was quickly taken up by the “older historical school of economics” — e.g., Bruno Hildebrand (1812—78), Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher (1817—94), and Karl Knies (1821—98) — and eventually by their “younger” counterparts, the so-called “socialists of the chair” (Kathedersozialismus).

对于这个由英国政治经济学创造的抽象的、不真实的世界，李斯特取代了特定社会的经济现实，在这个社会中，物质利益与文化的所有其他方面，包括语言、文学和历史，密不可分地联系在一起。特别是在《政治经济学国家体系》(1841)中，李斯特坚持认为，不同社会的经济法律各不相同，个人利益总是在受各种社会制度制约的社会背景下得到追求，并呼吁建立由德国政府控制和指导的“国民经济”，其政策将基于对德国现实的实证观察，至少暂时包括经济保护主义。迪尔凯姆在1903年写道，李斯特对“人民精神”的独特描述“无疑是一个晦涩、神秘的概念，国民经济的定义本身就排除了真正科学定律的可能性，因为它的对象被认为是独一无二的，因此排除了比较。”但是李斯特已经取得了重要的进步，涂尔干立即补充道，“通过引入经济投机的观点，社会有一个真实的存在，它自己生活的表现形式包括与经济现象相互作用的关系”(1982:197ー8)。这一观点很快被“较老的历史经济学派”(例如布鲁诺•希尔德布兰德(Bruno Hildebrand，1812-78)、威廉·罗雪尔(1817-94)和卡尔•尼斯(Karl Knies，1821-98))所接受，最终被他们的“年轻”对手——所谓的“主席社会主义者”(socialists of the board，即凯瑟德社会主义)所接受。

The primary objection of the “older” historical school to classical economics was methodological — i.e., that the appropriate subject matter of economics is not a body of inferences drawn from abstract principles of economy, but rather the empirical observation of the economic realities of past and present societies — in short, that economics is an inductive rather than a deductive science. In Die Nationalokonomie der Gegenwart und Zukunft (1848), for example, Hildebrand attacked the alleged universality of the principles guiding Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776), insisting that Smith’s premises simply did not apply to the peculiarities of German conditions (Kisch 1968a: 357). Similarly, in Die politische Okonomie vom Standpunkte der geschichtliche Method (1853), the patriotic Knies — Hildebrand’s student at Marburg — attacked the classical emphasis on individual self-interest, not simply as ahistorical and insensitive to social and cultural context, but as “subversive” of his conception of a stable social order, “an organically evolving community, which at each stage of its development requires a particular form of economic analysis’’ (Kisch 1968a: 423).

“旧”历史学派对古典经济学的主要反对意见是方法论上的ーー即经济学的适当主题不是从抽象的经济学原理中得出的推论，而是对过去和现在社会经济现实的实证观察ーー简而言之，经济学是一门归纳而非演绎的科学。例如，希尔德布兰德在《现实与未来的民族经济学》(Die Nationalokonomie der Gegenwart und Zukunft，1848)一书中，抨击了亚当 · 斯密(Adam Smith)的《国富论》(Wealth of Nations，1776)中指导原则的所谓普遍性，坚称斯密的前提根本不适用于德国的特殊情况(Kisch 1968a: 357)。同样，在《历史学方法的政治学评论》(Die politische Okonomie vom Standponkte der geschichtliche Method，1853)中，爱国的尼斯人ーー希尔德布兰德在马堡大学的学生ーー抨击了对个人利益的经典强调，不仅是因为它不符合历史，对社会和文化背景不敏感，而且是因为它“颠覆”了他关于稳定社会秩序的概念，即“一个有机发展的社区，在其发展的每个阶段都需要一种特定形式的经济分析”(Kisch 1968a: 423)。

Finally, in a series of volumes, Roscher — whom Durkheim called “the founder of the historical school’’ — defended his “historico-physiological’’ method in contrast to the “philosophical-idealist” approach of the classical economists, insisting that the object of political economy was not to establish the best possible state of things, but to describe the actual stage at which each society’s economy, in conjunction with its other institutions, had arrived in the course of its historical development (Salin 1968: 559). Durkheim summarized:

最后，在一系列的著作中，被涂尔干称为“历史学派的创始人”的罗舍尔，与古典经济学家的“哲学唯心主义”方法相比，为他的“历史生理学”方法进行了辩护，坚持认为政治经济学的目标不是建立事物的最佳可能状态，而是描述每个社会的经济，连同其他制度，在其历史发展的过程中到达的实际阶段(萨林1968:559)。迪尔凯姆总结道:

This school has had an original influence on the evolution of political economy. . . Without ever having entirely abandoned the idea of historical research as a means of judging the value of a given political action in any given political circumstance, it has interested itself in facts remote both in space and time, attempting to study them solely with a view to understanding them. To some extent, it has introduced comparisons into economic history. (1982: 198)

这一学派对政治经济学的演变产生了独创性的影响... ... 它从未完全放弃将历史研究作为在任何特定政治环境下判断特定政治行动价值的一种手段的想法，而是对远离时间和空间的事实感兴趣，试图仅仅为了理解这些事实而研究它们。在某种程度上，它把比较引入了经济史。(1982:198)

But it was the “younger historical school’’ or “socialists of the chair’’ (Kathedersozialismus), led by Gustav Schmoller (1838—1917) and Adolf Heinrich Gotthelf Wagner (1835—1917), whose works truly captured Durkheim’s imagination (1982: 198—9). Unlike its “older’’ predecessor, Hayek explains, this “younger’’ school was not simply interested in the history of unique economic institutions or distinctive historical situations; rather, they regarded historical research as providing the empirical foundation for genuine theories of society: “Through the study of historical development it hoped to arrive at the laws of development of social wholes, from which, in turn, could be deduced the historical necessities governing each phase of this development” (1968: 125).

但是，正是由古斯塔夫 · 施莫勒(1838ー1917)和阿道夫 · 海因里希 · 戈特福 · 瓦格纳(1835ー1917)领导的“年轻的历史学派”或“主席社会主义者”(Kathedersozialism) ，他们的作品真正抓住了涂尔干的想象力(1982:198ー9)。哈耶克解释说，与其“老”的前辈不同，这个“年轻”学派不仅仅对独特的经济制度或独特的历史情况的历史感兴趣，而且他们认为历史研究为真正的社会理论提供了经验基础: “通过对历史发展的研究，它希望得出社会整体发展的规律，从而可以推断出支配这种发展的每个阶段的历史必要性”(1968:125)。

Initially, Hayek’s characterization seems ill htted to Schmoller, Professor of Political Science at the Universities of Halle (1864—72), Strasbourg (1872—82), and Berlin (1882 — 1913), whose rejection of classical economic theory with its insistence that all economic laws are inductive generalizations sometimes resembled a desire to replace theory with history altogether. At the very least, Schmoller was convinced that useful economic theory can only be the result of an enormous amount of descriptive analysis of both past and present events, institutions, and social structures (Fischer 1968: 61—2). It was this view of theory which the Viennese economist Carl Menger attacked in his Untersuchungen uber die Methode der Sozialwissenschaften und der politischen Okonomie insbesondere (1883); and when Schmoller replied the same year in his Jahrbuch, the result was the Methodenstreit which dominated German social sciences for the next hfty years. But Schmoller’s historically informed calls for conservative social reforms were not quite so innocent of theoretical presuppositions as his role in the Methodenstreit would suggest. In Uber einige Grundfragen des Rechts und der Volkswirtschaft (1874—5) — a work Durkheim studied “with care and interest’’ (1907: 612) — Schmoller based his demand for a more equitable distribution of income on theoretical premises of undeniable romantic provenance. Quite beyond material factors, Schmoller argued, there are psychological and ethical causes which determine the nature and degree of social and economic progress; and the bond which links these material and non-material factors is not simply the state, but “something deeper: the possession in common of language, history, memories, customs, and ideas. It is a world of common emotions and ideas, a mastery of common objectives; more than this, it is a common way of life arising out of these correlated psychological elements and becoming a reality. It is a common ethos influencing all the actions of mankind and so also its political economy’’ (1975: 44). Durkheim described Schmoller’s Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre (2 vols., 1900—4) as “a whole sociology seen from the economic viewpoint’’ (1982: 206).

最初，哈耶克的角色塑造似乎受到了哈雷大学(university of Halle，1864-72)、斯特拉斯堡大学(strasburg，1872-82)和柏林大学(Berlin，1882-1913)政治学教授施莫勒(Schmoller)的反对。施莫勒坚持认为所有经济规律都是归纳性概括，因此拒绝接受古典经济理论，有时就像希望用历史完全取代理论一样。至少，Schmoller 确信有用的经济理论只能是对过去和现在的事件、制度和社会结构进行大量描述性分析的结果(Fischer 1968:61ー2)。维也纳经济学家卡尔•门格尔(Carl Menger)在他的《关于社会科学方法和政治经济学的特殊性的研究》(Untersuchungen uber die Methoden der sozialwisscience chaften und der politische Okonomie inbesondere，1883)一书中抨击的正是这种理论观点，而当施莫勒同年在他的《 Jahrbuch 》一书中作出回应时，其结果就是在接下来的半个世纪里主导德国社会科学的方法论争论。但是 Schmoller 对于保守的社会改革的历史性的呼吁并不像他在方法论争论中的角色所暗示的那样纯粹是理论上的假设。在《优步的一些法律和国民经济的基本问题》(1874-5)中，涂尔干“带着关心和兴趣”研究了一部作品(1907:612) ，施莫勒将他对更公平的收入分配的要求建立在不可否认的浪漫出身的理论前提之上。Schmoller 认为，除了物质因素之外，还有心理和伦理因素决定着社会和经济进步的性质和程度; 连接这些物质和非物质因素的纽带不仅仅是国家，而是“更深层次的东西: 共同拥有的语言、历史、记忆、风俗和思想。它是一个有着共同情感和想法的世界，是对共同目标的把握; 不仅如此，它还是一种由这些相互关联的心理因素产生并成为现实的共同生活方式。它是一种共同的精神，影响着人类的一切行动，也影响着人类的政治经济”(1975:44)。涂尔干把施莫勒的《一般国民经济学的基础》(1900-4第2卷)描述为“从经济学角度看的整个社会学”(1982:206)。

Wagner, who was Professor of Political Economy at the university of Berlin from 1870 to 1916, and who joined Schmoller in establishing the Verein fur Sozialpolitik in 1872, tried to maintain a via media between Schmoller and Menger in the Methodenstreit, although his sympathies probably lay more with Menger (Meyer 1968: 430). An “Old Prussian” by choice, Wagner’s rejection of classical economics and industrial-commercial capitalism (and thus his frequent agreement with many of the German socialists) was based on arguments that were not only economic but also moral, Protestant, romantic, nationalistic, and occasionally anti-Semitic. In Allgemeine oder theoretische Volkswirtschaftslehre (1876), whose discussion of the concept of liberty Durkheim greatly admired, Wagner described political economy as “an organic permeation, not a mechanical parallelism, of individual characteristics. Like the nation, it is a real whole which in crises shows itself to be an organism.’’[64](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark76) In language that anticipated his later discussion of anomic suicide, Durkheim praised Wagner for showing that “whatever has previously been said about it, individual liberty has no absolute value in itself, but has, on the contrary, grave inconveniences which must be forestalled by limiting that liberty. In the present condition of our societies, liberty is thus morally good only if it is restrained” (1887b: 41-2).

瓦格纳曾在1870年至1916年间担任柏林大学(university of Berlin)政治经济学教授，并于1872年与施莫勒一起建立了“社会政治运动联盟”(verin fur Sozialpolitik)。瓦格纳试图在施莫勒和门格尔之间通过媒体保持联系，尽管他的同情心可能更多地落在门格尔身上(迈耶1968:430)。作为一个自愿的“老普鲁士人”，瓦格纳拒绝古典经济学和工商资本主义(因此他经常与许多德国社会主义者达成一致)是基于不仅经济而且道德，新教，浪漫主义，民族主义，偶尔反犹太主义的论点。在《国民经济学》(1876)一书中，瓦格纳将政治经济学描述为“个人特征的有机渗透，而不是机械的平行。与国家一样，它也是一个真正的整体，在危机中显示出自己是一个有机体。”迪尔凯姆赞扬瓦格纳表明: “不管以前怎么说，个人自由本身没有绝对价值，相反，它带来了严重的不便，必须通过限制这种自由来预防。在我们社会的现状中，自由只有在受到限制的情况下才是道德上的美好”(1887b: 41-2)。

Of these Kathedersozialisten, Durkheim acknowledged, much is heard in France. “But if the word is known,’’ he added, “the thing is known far less well.’’ Referring to the burgeoning literature on Wagner and Schmoller which had been appearing in the pages of the Journal des economistes, Durkheim complained that “the orthodox economists, who among us retain that powerful influence that they have lost in other European countries, have done everything possible to misrepresent the mind and character [of the ‘socialists of the chair’]’’ (1887b: 34). Clearly, Durkheim conceived his role as one of re-introducing the German Kathedersozialisten to a largely uncomprehending French audience, and of explaining their place in the future development of French social science. The most significant idea of the Kathedersozialisten, Durkheim explained, is their intimate rapprochement between political economy and ethics — one which “has simultaneously revitalized these two sciences.’’ According to the opposing arguments of the Manchester school, Durkheim observed, the individual is both the original source and the ultimate goal of all economic relations, a position which reduces “society” to a metaphysical status unapproachable by science. Referring in particular to Gustave de Molinari’s L'Evolution politique et la revolution (1884), Durkheim noted that “the most consequential” of the Manchester economists “have not hesitated to declare that national sentiments are only the survivals of prejudices destined to one day disappear. Under these conditions,” Durkheim warned, preparing arguments to be directed against Spencer in De la division du travail social, “economic activity can have no other motive than egoism, and thereby political economy is radically separated from ethics, if indeed any moral ideal remains to humanity once all social bonds have been dissolved” (1887b: 37).

迪尔凯姆承认，在这些 Kathedersozialisten 中，法国人听到了很多。“但是，如果这个词已经为人所知,”他补充说，“那么这件事就不那么为人所知了。”迪尔凯姆在谈到出现在《经济学家杂志》(Journal des Economistes)上的关于瓦格纳(Wagner)和施莫勒(Schmoller)的新兴文献时抱怨道，“正统经济学家在我们中间保留着他们在其他欧洲国家失去的强大影响力，他们尽一切可能歪曲(‘主席的社会主义者’的思想和性格)”(1887b: 34)。显然，迪尔凯姆认为他的角色是将德国的凯瑟琳介绍给大部分不理解的法国听众，并解释他们在法国社会科学未来发展中的地位。迪尔凯姆解释说，Kathedersozialisten 最重要的思想是他们在政治经济学和伦理学之间的亲密关系ーー这种关系“同时重振了这两门科学”根据曼彻斯特学派的对立论点，涂尔干观察到，个人既是所有经济关系的原始来源，也是最终目标，这一立场将“社会”降低到科学无法接近的形而上学地位。迪尔凯姆特别提到了古斯塔夫·德·莫利纳里《进化论政治与革命》(1884) ，他指出，曼彻斯特经济学家中“最重要的”一位“毫不犹豫地宣称，民族情绪只是注定有一天会消失的偏见的残余。在这些情况下,”涂尔干警告说，准备在社会劳动分工中反对斯宾塞的论点，“经济活动除了利己主义没有其他动机，因此政治经济从根本上与伦理分离，如果确实有任何道德理想留给人类，一旦所有的社会纽带已经解散”(1887b: 37)。

Against this mistaken and potentially destructive British conception, Durkheim observed, Wagner and Schmoller have insisted that the needs and interests of individuals are really abstractions, while those of society are real and concrete; that society is thus a “veritable being” with “its own nature and its personality”; and that the practical functions of ethics and political economy, which is to make societies possible, thus coincide: “albeit from different points of view,” Durkheim observed, “both . . . seek to know how societies can live and grow” (1887b: 38). This seeking of the Kathedersozialisten, Durkheim added in his “Cours de science sociale” (1888), was decidedly inductive rather than deductive; indeed, it was only by inductive means that they — and, arguably, Durkheim himself — became Sozialisten at all. Durkheim observed approvingly:

迪尔凯姆指出，针对这种错误的、可能具有破坏性的英国概念，瓦格纳和施莫勒坚持认为，个人的需求和利益实际上是抽象的，而社会的需求和利益是真实和具体的; 社会因此是一个“真正的存在”，具有“自身的性质和个性”; 伦理学和政治经济学的实际功能，使社会成为可能，因此是一致的: “尽管从不同的角度来看,”迪尔凯姆指出，“两者都... ... 寻求了解社会如何生存和成长”(1887b: 38)。迪尔凯姆在他的《社会科学课程》(1888)中补充说，这种对 Kathedersozialisten 的追求显然是归纳而不是演绎的，事实上，只有通过归纳的方式，他们ーー可以说是迪尔凯姆自己ーー才成为了社会主义者。迪尔凯姆赞许地评论道:

Instead of starting with human nature and deducing science from it as the orthodox economists did, the German school attempts to observe economic facts as they present themselves in reality ... If this school openly leans toward a certain form of socialism, it is because, when we seek to see things as they are, we observe that, in fact, in all known societies, economic phenomena transcend the individual’s sphere of action, that they constitute a function which is not domestic and private but social. (1978a: 60)

德国学派没有像正统经济学家那样从人性出发，从中推断出科学，而是试图观察经济事实在现实中的表现... ... 如果这个学派公开倾向于某种形式的社会主义，那是因为，当我们试图看到事物的本来面目时，我们观察到，事实上，在所有已知的社会中，经济现象超越了个人的行动范围，它们构成了一种功能，这种功能不是家庭和私人的，而是社会的。(1978a: 60)

In 1887 Durkheim also entertained three objections to the Kathedersozialisten. The ®rst was that the differences between British and German political economy had been exaggerated, for the utilitarians, no less than the Kathedersozialisten, had made the collective interest of a society’s members the foundation of ethical judgment. But for Durkheim, whose thinking about egoism and altruism had clearly deepened since 1883, the differences were important. For the utilitarians, he observed, collective interest “is only a form of personal interest. Altruism is only a disguised egoism, which complacently ignores its true nature; and if, in this doctrine, there is some trait common to both ethics and political economy, it is because the utilitarians reduce both to being nothing but the implementation of egoism. For the German economist, by contrast, the interests of the individual and those of society are far from constantly coinciding. Just as society is something other than the arithmetic sum of its citizens, it has in each category of functions its own ends, which infinitely transcend those of individuals and are not even of the same type. Its destinies are not ours, and yet we must work for them’’ (1887b: 38-9).

1887年，涂尔干也对凯瑟琳提出了三个异议。第一，英国和德国政治经济学之间的差异被夸大了，因为功利主义者，不亚于 Kathedersozialisten，把社会成员的集体利益作为伦理判断的基础。但是对于涂尔干来说，他对利己主义和利他主义的思考自1883年以来明显加深了，这种差异是重要的。对功利主义者来说，集体利益“只是个人利益的一种形式。利他主义只是一种伪装的利己主义，它自满地忽视了自己的真正本质; 如果在这种学说中，伦理和政治经济学都有一些共同的特征，那是因为功利主义者把两者都降低为只是实施利己主义。相比之下，对于德国经济学家而言，个人利益与社会利益远非经常一致。正如社会不是其公民的算术总和一样，它在每一类功能中都有自己的目的，这些目的无限地超越了个人的目的，甚至不属于同一类。它的命运不是我们的，但我们必须为它们工作”(1887b: 38-9)。

A second objection to the Kathedersozialisten was that this convergence of the realms of ethics and political economy ignored all differences between them. But Durkheim argued that the German achievement was precisely to have identified the distinction between ethics and political economy as one between form and content, and then to have described accurately their reciprocal relations:

第二个反对意见是，这种道德和政治经济领域的趋同忽视了它们之间的所有差异。但涂尔干认为，德国的成就恰恰是将伦理学和政治经济学之间的区别确定为形式和内容之间的区别，然后准确地描述了它们之间的相互关系:

What properly belongs to ethics, is this form of obligation that becomes attached to certain ways of acting, and marks them with its stamp. Economic phenomena can, under certain conditions, assume this form like all social facts . . . When [the] collective utility [of economic phenomena] has been clearly demonstrated, when they have received the consecration of time, they appear to consciences as obligatory, and are transformed into juridical or moral prescriptions.

真正属于伦理学的，是这种形式的义务，它附着在某些行为方式上，并用它的印记来标记它们。在一定条件下，经济现象可以像所有社会事实一样呈现出这种形式... ... 当(经济现象)的集体效用得到明确证明时，当它们得到时间的神圣化时，它们在良心上似乎是义务性的，并转化为法律或道德规范。

The origin of law and ethics thus lies in custom — i.e., “collective habits, constant ways of acting which are found to be common to an entire society . . . [the] crystallization of human conduct.’’ This crystallization achieved, the ethical prescriptions in turn react back on economic phenomena. Ethics, Durkheim emphasized, “is not absorbed by political economy; rather, all social functions contribute to produce that form to which economic phenomena are obliged to submit even as they contribute to making the form’’ (1887b: 39—41).

因此，法律和道德的起源在于习俗ーー也就是说，“集体习惯、持续不断的行为方式被发现是整个社会共有的... ... 是人类行为的结晶。”这一结晶的实现，反过来又使道德处方对经济现象产生反作用。迪尔凯姆强调，伦理学“不被政治经济学所吸收; 相反，所有的社会功能都有助于产生经济现象必须服从的形式，即使它们有助于形成形式”(1887b: 39-41)。

The third objection, raised in Menger’s Untersuchen uber die Methode der Sozialwissenschaften, was that these relations between ethics and political economy — alluded to by a variety of ingenious historical examples — remained insufficiently developed in economic theory. Thoroughly aware of the Methodenstreit and the issues it raised, and consistently skeptical of historical description in the absence of theoretical generalization, Durkheim was understandably sympathetic with Menger: “In order to make intelligible a perfect intimacy of political economy and ethics,’’ he agreed, “it is not enough to show, through some examples, that economic events have a repercussion in ethics; for everything in the world is interconnected, and there is nothing astonishing in two parts of that reality reacting on one another. Rather,” Durkheim concluded, “we would have to show that these two orders of facts, even while remaining distinct, are nonetheless of the same nature” (1887b: 36) ± the demonstration, of course, from which De la division du travail social derives much of its force.

门格尔在《社会科学方法论研究》一书中提出的第三个反对意见是，这些伦理与政治经济之间的关系(各种巧妙的历史例子暗示了这一点)在经济理论中仍然不够发达。迪尔凯姆完全了解方法论争论及其引发的问题，并且在缺乏理论概括的情况下始终对历史描述持怀疑态度，可以理解他对门格尔的同情: “为了使政治经济学和伦理学之间的完美亲密关系变得可理解,”他同意，“仅仅通过一些例子来证明经济事件对伦理学的影响是不够的; 因为世界上的一切事物都是相互关联的，在现实的两个部分相互作用并没有什么令人惊讶的。相反,”涂尔干总结道，“我们必须证明，这两种事实的顺序，即使保持不同，仍然具有相同的性质”(1887b: 36) ± 的论证，当然，德拉分工社会的力量很大程度上来源于这种论证。

For Durkheim, therefore, the ultimate signi®cance of the German economists was their contribution, not to economics, but to ethics. Initially, this signi®cance derived from their insistence on an inductive method:

因此，对涂尔干来说，德国经济学家的最终意义不在于他们对经济学的贡献，而在于他们对伦理学的贡献。最初，这个意义来源于他们对归纳法的坚持:

Until now, for every school of ethics, for the utilitarians as for the Kantians, the problem of ethics consisted essentially in determining the general form of moral conduct, from when the content of moral conduct was then deduced. One began by establishing that the principle of ethics is the “good,” or “duty,” or “utility,” and then drew from this axiom certain maxims which constituted “practical” or “applied” ethics. From the works that we have just summarized, [referring to Wagner and Schmoller], it results, on the contrary, that here as elsewhere the form does not pre-exist the content, but derives from and expresses this content. One cannot construct the whole of ethics in order to then impose it on things; rather, one must observe things in order to induce ethics from them.

到目前为止，对于每一个道德学派，对于功利主义者和康德主义者来说，道德问题本质上在于确定道德行为的一般形式，从而推导出道德行为的内容。人们首先确立道德原则是“善”、“责任”或“效用”，然后从这个公理中提取出构成“实践”或“应用”道德的某些准则。从我们刚才总结的作品，[参考瓦格纳和施莫勒] ，它的结果，相反，这里的形式不预先存在的内容，而是来源于和表达这种内容。一个人不能构建整个伦理学，然后把它强加于事物上; 相反，一个人必须观察事物，以便从中引出伦理学。

But ultimately the signi®cance of the Kathedersozialisten resulted from their attacks on the philosophy of natural law ± attacks that rendered all rights and duties historically contingent, and thus inherently malleable. Until recently, Durkheim observed, “the philosophy which reigned in Germany . . . believed it possible to deduce an immutable ethic from the nature of man in general, an ethic valid for all times and all places.” Precisely because they were reluctant to resign themselves to the blind, inexorable processes of natural law, and thus to forgo political and economic reforms which were palpably desirable, the German economists set themselves the task of demonstrating that economic phenomena themselves contained moral elements of considerable flexibility, and thus that all rights and duties were the products of contingent historical circumstances. To have thus combatted Naturrecht — the doctrine of natural law ± was “one of the great services performed by the German economists” (1887b: 42-3).

但最终，凯瑟德社会主义者的重要性源于他们对自然法哲学的攻击，这种攻击使所有的权利和义务在历史上都是偶然的，因而具有内在的可塑性。直到最近，涂尔干评论道: “统治德国的哲学... ... 相信有可能从一般人的本性中推断出一种永恒的伦理，一种适用于所有时代和所有地方的伦理。”正因为德国经济学家不愿屈从于盲目的、不可阻挡的自然法进程，从而放弃明显可取的政治和经济改革，他们为自己设定的任务是证明经济现象本身包含相当灵活的道德因素，因此所有权利和义务都是偶然历史环境的产物。这样与自然法作斗争ーー自然法学说是“德国经济学家所做的伟大贡献之一”(1887b: 42-3)。

Durkheim's gratitude for this service was not unleavened by scientific reservations: “From the fact that moral phenomena are more mobile than others,” he observed quite critically, the German economists “have concluded that such phenomena might be transformed voluntarily by the legislator. Because they have their origin not in the nature of material things, but in the conscience of man, they have seen there artificial combinations which the human will can unmake or remake as it made them.’’ But one of the most important contributions of contemporary psychology, Durkheim argued, was its demonstration that social facts were as “natural” as any other phenomena, distinguishable from the other realms of nature only by differences of degree. While more flexible than material facts, the complexity of social facts rendered them no less malleable by rational means: “. . . the majority of moral and social institutions are the result, not of reasoning and calculation, but of obscure causes, of subconscious sentiments, of motives unconnected to the effects which they produce, and which they cannot, as a consequence, explain’’ (1887b: 45; Miller 1996: 26). Misled by their exaggerated confidence in legislative action, the Kathedersozialisten had unwittingly returned to an inorganic, Rousseau-like conception of society as an “artificial arrangement unrelated to the nature of things’’ — an interpretation of Rousseau he would later reconsider (see chapter 5, pp. 268—301). “At bottom,’’ Durkheim concluded in his reply to Deploige, “I have rather an aversion for the socialism of the chair, which itself has no sympathy for sociology — whose principle it denies’’ (1907: 613—14).

涂尔干对这项服务的感激之情并没有因为科学的保留而消失: “从道德现象比其他现象更具流动性这一事实来看,”他相当批判地评论道，德国经济学家“得出结论，这种现象可能会被立法者自愿改变。因为它们的起源不在于物质的本质，而在于人类的良知，它们看到了人类意志可以取消或重新制造的人为组合。”但是涂尔干认为，当代心理学最重要的贡献之一，是它证明了社会事实和其他任何现象一样是“自然的”，只有程度上的差异才能区别于自然界的其他领域。尽管社会事实比物质事实更具灵活性，但它们的复杂性也使它们在理性手段下具有同样的可塑性: “ ... ... 大多数道德和社会制度不是推理和计算的结果，而是模糊原因、潜意识情感和动机的结果，这些动机与它们产生的效果无关，因此它们无法解释”(1887b: 45; Miller 1996:26)。受到他们对立法行动夸大信心的误导，Kathedersozialisten 在不知不觉中回归了一种无机的、卢梭式的社会概念，即“与事物本质无关的人为安排”ーー这是他后来重新考虑的对卢梭的解释(见第5章，第268-301页)。涂尔干在回答德普洛伊的问题时总结道: “从根本上说，我对椅子的社会主义有些反感，因为椅子本身并不同情社会学ーー它否认社会学的原则。”(1907:613ー14)。

But if Durkheim thus admired the Kathedersozialisten for their recognition of the ethical dimension of economic phenomena, he also urged that “it is not with economic facts alone that [ethics] is in relation, but with all social facts from which it derives and which form its contents’’ (1887b: 49). Here in particular Durkheim referred to “[t]hat part of ethics that is called the philosophy of law’’ which, by this reasoning, had much to learn from the practical realities of “positive’’ law. The initial advantage of the Germans here was that the philosophy of law had never been reserved for philosophers alone; on the contrary, Durkheim observed, even during the 18th-century preoccupation with natural law, German jurists had concerned themselves with legal philosophy, and unconsciously directed the study of law in a slightly more positive direction. As the romantic movement gathered strength in the early 19th century, this tendency was accentuated, producing effects in the study of law similar to those in the study of political economy.

但是，如果迪尔凯姆因此钦佩 Kathedersozialisten 对经济现象的伦理层面的认识，他也敦促道: “(伦理学)不仅与经济事实有关，而且与它所衍生和构成其内容的所有社会事实有关”(1887b: 49)。在这里，涂尔干特别提到了“伦理学的一部分，即所谓的法哲学”，通过这种推理，可以从“实在”法的实践现实中学到很多东西。德国人在这方面的最初优势在于，法律哲学从来不仅仅是哲学家的专利; 相反，涂尔干观察到，即使在18世纪专注于自然法的时候，德国法学家也关注法律哲学，并且不知不觉地将法律研究引向一个稍微积极一点的方向。19世纪初，随着浪漫主义运动的兴起，这一趋势日益明显，在法学研究中产生了与政治经济学研究类似的效果。

The central figure here was Friedrich Karl von Savigny (1779-1861), the founder of the historical school of jurisprudence. Born in Frankfurt am Main to a wealthy, aristocratic family, Savigny taught Roman law at Marburg and Landshut before becoming professor of law and eventually rector at the newly created University of Berlin in 1810, where he remained for the next 32 years. In his pamphlet Vom Beruf unserer feit fur Gesetzgebung und Rechts-wissenschaft (1814), published as an argument against the popular demand for the codihcation of German civil law on the model of the French and Austrian legal codes, and again in his introduction to the ®rst volume of the feitschrift fur geschichtliche Rechtswissenschaft (1815), Savigny molded the ideas of Montesquieu, Burke, and Justus Moser into the foundations of the romantic, historical school of law.

这里的中心人物是弗里德里希·卡尔·冯·萨维尼(1779-1861) ，法学历史学派的创始人。萨维尼出生于美因河畔法兰克福一个富裕的贵族家庭，在马堡和兰茨胡特教授罗马法，后来成为法学教授，最终于1810年在新成立的柏林大学担任校长，并在那里工作了32年。在他1814年出版的小册子《为法律而战》(Vom Beruf unserer feit für Gesetzgebung und Rechts-wissenchaft)中，作为反对以法国和奥地利法典为模式编纂德国民法的普遍要求的论据，以及在他1815年出版的《法律史记》第一卷的导言中，萨维尼把孟德斯鸠、伯克和贾斯特斯 · 莫泽的思想塑造成浪漫主义历史学派法律的基础。

Positive law, Savigny insisted, is not the product of reason, but rather of the common, collective beliefs of a particular society — in short, of its Volksgeist. Like its language, manners, and customs, a society’s positive law thus evolves as the result of a continuous, organic process, subject to silent, anonymous, and largely irrational causes rather than any intentional, creative effort. Since positive law is thus determined by the peculiar history and nature of the society in question, legal reform must not be arbitrarily attempted through legislation alone, but only gradually introduced after detailed historical research has yielded the “organic principle’’ of a society’s law — a task Savigny undertook in his monumental Geschichte des romischen Rechts in Mittelalter (7 vols., 1815—34) and System des heutigen romischen Rechts (8 vols., 1840—9). These historical, evolutionary, and inherently sociological arguments faced signi®cant opposition in Germany, particularly from Hegel and his followers; but in fact, the historical school of jurisprudence dominated the study of law in German universities for the next half century.

萨维尼坚持认为，实在法不是理性的产物，而是某个特定社会的共同集体信仰ーー简言之，是其人民精神的产物。就像它的语言、礼仪和习俗一样，一个社会的实在法也是作为一个连续的、有机的过程的结果而进化的，受制于无声的、匿名的、大部分是非理性的原因，而不是任何有意的、创造性的努力。由于实在法是由有关社会的特殊历史和性质所决定的，所以法律改革不能仅仅通过立法来武断地尝试，而是在详细的历史研究产生了社会法的“有机原则”之后才逐步引入——这是萨维尼在他的巨著《中世纪罗姆人法的历史》(1815-34)和《今天的罗姆人法制》(1840-9)中所承担的任务。这些历史的、进化的和固有的社会学论点在德国面临着强烈的反对，尤其是来自黑格尔及其追随者的反对; 但事实上，法学的历史学派在接下来的半个世纪里主导了德国大学的法学研究。

For Durkheim, the most interesting products of this dominance were Rudolf von Ihering (1818—92) and Albert-Hermann Post (1839—95). A professor of law at Gottingen, Ihering resisted certain arguments of both Hegel and Savigny — e.g., Hegel’s indifference to the role played by private interests and public utility in the determination of legal phenomena, and Savigny’s parallel indifference to the conscious, purposive aspect of the struggle to protect these private and public interests. But Ihering was no less an antagonist of Naturrecht than Savigny. In Der fweck im Recht (2 vols., 1877—83), he insisted upon constraint as the “external condition’’ of law, and argued that legal phenomena could not be understood without a grasp of the ends or purposes giving rise to them. This “new conception of the philosophy of law,” Durkheim observed, “has made a certain clamor in Germany,” but “appears to remain quite unknown in France” (1887b: 50, 58) - a situation his 1887 essay was written to correct.

对涂尔干来说，这种优势最有趣的产品是鲁道夫 · 冯 · 伊赫林(1818ー92)和阿尔伯特 · 赫尔曼 · 波斯特(1839ー95)。伊赫林是 Gottingen 大学的法学教授，他反对黑格尔和萨维尼的某些论点，例如黑格尔对私人利益和公共效用在决定法律现象中所扮演的角色的漠视，以及萨维尼对保护这些私人和公共利益的斗争中有意识、有目的的方面的漠视。但伊赫林与萨维尼一样，都是自然法的对手。在《法律上的约束》(2卷，1877-83)一书中，他坚持把约束作为法律的“外部条件”，认为如果不能把握产生约束的目的或目的，就不能理解法律现象。涂尔干指出，这种“法律哲学的新概念”“在德国引起了一定的轰动”，但“在法国似乎仍然相当不为人知”(1887b: 50,58)——他1887年的文章就是为了纠正这种情况而写的。

“Since Socrates,” Durkheim observed, “philosophers have taken on the habit of reducing reality to combinations of concepts. They think they have explained the life of the individual as much as that of society by reducing it to a system of abstract ideas which are logically connected.” Proceeding in this utterly Platonic manner, philosophers grasp only the “general frameworks in which things move,” not the “energy which moves these things.” But to live, Durkheim insisted, adopting a more Aristotelian posture, is not simply to think, it is to act — i.e., “to affirm one’s existence by an act of personal energy (aus eigener Kraft).’’ The source of such individual acts is the idea of an end, of a final cause; and the only way to explain “the facts of the interior life’’ is thus to reveal its goals. “[I]t is the same for social life,’’ Durkheim then argued, “and since law is a sociological phenomenon, we must, in order to explain it, search for its end. To demonstrate a rule of law is not to prove that it is true, but that it performs some function, that it is well adjusted to the end that it must fulfill (richtig)” (1887b: 51) — precisely the functional theory of law advanced in De la division du travail social.

涂尔干说: “自从苏格拉底以来，哲学家们就养成了将现实简化为概念组合的习惯。他们认为他们已经解释了个人的生活，就像解释了社会的生活一样，他们把个人的生活简化为一个抽象的思想体系，这些思想体系在逻辑上是相互联系的。”以这种柏拉图式的方式进行，哲学家们只掌握了“事物运动的一般框架”，而不是“推动这些事物的能量”但是，涂尔干坚持认为，采取更亚里士多德式的姿态，生活不仅仅是思考，而是行动ーー也就是说，“通过个人能量的行为(aus eigener Kraft)来肯定一个人的存在。”这种个人行为的根源是一个终结的想法，一个最终的原因; 因此，解释“内在生活的事实”的唯一方法就是揭示它的目的。“社会生活也是如此,”涂尔干接着说，“既然法律是一种社会学现象，我们就必须为了解释它而寻找它的终点。”。证明法治不是为了证明它是真实的，而是为了证明它发挥了某种功能，为了达到它必须实现的目的而进行了很好的调整”(1887b: 51)ーー这正是《社会劳动分工》中提出的功能性法律理论。

Durkheim thus embraced Ihering’s essentially Aristotelian approach to the explanation of legal phenomena by the ends that they serve. What he rather clearly could not embrace was Ihering’s conscious, purposive notion of the meaning of ends: “. . . by an end, [Ihering] seems to understand the conscious idea of a goal, or at least of one of the goals of conduct. If such is the meaning of the word,’’ Durkheim observed, “there is a multitude of our actions from whence any idea of ends is absent. How many times we act without knowing the goal toward which we tend!’’ This dismissal of Ihering’s “rather metaphysical” conception of conscious ends Durkheim owed, not only to Spinoza’s Ethics (1677), which he greatly admired, but also to a precocious grasp of the significance of psychological experiments into hypnotic suggestion currently conducted in France, and thus to the emerging psychology of the unconscious — an interest that Durkheim had clearly acquired since his Sens lectures: “To explain how these kinds of unconscious adaptations are made,’’ Durkheim urged, “it would be necessary to go beyond the conscience, to study the nature of that obscure and diffuse intelligence which has no small role in the direction of our lives, the mechanism of the emotions, inclinations, instincts, habits, their action on our conduct and the way in which they are modi®ed when the circumstances require it.'' In societies, as in the individual, Durkheim now pursued the analogy, “changes occur which have causes and no ends at all, something analogous to Darwin's individual variations. Some can be found which are useful, but this utility was not foreseen, and was not the determining cause'' (1887b: 5!-2)-

因此，迪尔凯姆接受了艾林的基本亚里士多德的方法，通过他们所服务的目的来解释法律现象。他显然不能接受的是伊赫林对目的意义的有意识、有目的的概念: “ ... ... 到最后，(伊赫林)似乎理解了目标的有意识概念，或者至少理解了行为的目标之一。“如果这就是这个词的意思,”涂尔干评论道，“那么我们的许多行为都是没有目的的。”。有多少次我们在行动时不知道我们的目标是什么!”迪尔凯姆这种对伊赫林“相当形而上学”的意识概念的否定，不仅归功于他非常欣赏的斯宾诺莎的《伦理学》(1677) ，而且归功于他对目前在法国进行的催眠暗示的心理实验意义的早熟把握,因此，迪尔凯姆开始关注潜意识的新兴心理学ーー这显然是自从他的森斯讲座以来，迪尔凯姆就开始关注的一个问题: “要解释这种无意识的适应是如何产生的,”迪尔凯姆敦促道，“就有必要超越良心，研究那种模糊和扩散的智力的本质，这种智力在我们生活的方向上起着不可小觑的作用，情绪、倾向、本能、习惯的机制，它们对我们行为的作用，以及它们在情况需要时被调整的方式。''在社会中，就像在个体中一样，迪尔凯姆现在追求这种类比，“变化发生时有原因，没有终点，类似于达尔文的个体变化。有些是有用的，但这种效用是没有预见到的，也不是决定性的原因”(1887b: 5！-2) -

Of this new psychology, Ihering appeared utterly ignorant. Still, Durkheim agreed with Ihering's general proposition — i.e., that social phenomena derive from practical causes. What, then, was the practical cause of law? Briefly, according to Ihering, it was “the need to assure the conditions of the existence of society,'' where “conditions” were subdivided into those to which law is irrelevant, those to which law is relevant only accidentally, and those which can be realized only through law. Interestingly, Ihering's second set of conditions, which arise when natural impulse fails to guarantee the social interest, included the prevention of suicides, celibates, pauperism, strikes, and monopolies: “As the society suffers from all these evils, it protects itself from them and fights them by means of law. Albeit exceptionally,” Durkheim observed, “it replaces the internal impulse which is lacking through an external, mechanical pressure'' (1887b: 53). But even the first set of conditions, Ihering argued, where the interests of society are sufficiently in accord with those of individuals that laws need not intervene (there are no laws, for example, “enforcing” self-preservation or procreation), provide no legitimacy for a doctrine of natural rights. “[W]e must not think,'' Ihering and Durkheim agreed, “that, in this sphere where society does not ordinarily intervene, the individual exercises rights which derive from his own nature and belong to him in his own right. Law is the hand of society weighing on the individual, and there the latter ceases to make itself felt, there are rights no longer.'' Even property rights, Durkheim insisted, exist only at the indulgence of society, and activities once considered voluntary (e.g., military service and elementary education) were now imposed by a society on its members (1887b:53—4).

对于这种新的心理学，伊赫林显得完全无知。尽管如此，迪尔凯姆还是同意伊赫林的一般性命题ーー即社会现象源于实际原因。那么，法律的实际原因是什么呢？简而言之，按照 Ihering 的说法，这是“确保社会存在条件的需要”，在这里，“条件”被细分为与法律无关的条件、与法律只有偶然相关的条件和只有通过法律才能实现的条件。有趣的是，当自然冲动不能保证社会利益时，伊赫林的第二套条件包括防止自杀、禁欲、贫困、罢工和垄断: “当社会遭受所有这些罪恶时，它保护自己免受它们的侵害，并通过法律手段与它们作斗争。迪尔凯姆观察到，“虽然这是个例外，但它取代了通过外部机械压力所缺乏的内部冲动”(1887b: 53)。但是，伊赫林认为，即使是第一组条件，如果社会利益与个人利益充分一致，法律无需干预(例如，没有法律“强制”自我保存或生育) ，也不能为自然权利学说提供合法性。“我们不能认为,”伊赫林和迪尔凯姆一致认为，“在这个社会通常不干预的领域，个人行使的权利源于他自己的本性，属于他自己的权利。法律是社会对个人施加压力的手，在那里，个人不再感到自己的存在，权利也不复存在。”涂尔干坚持认为，即使是财产权，也只是在社会的纵容下才存在的，曾经被认为是自愿的活动(例如，兵役和基础教育)现在被社会强加给其成员(1887b: 53ー4)。

If this was the end of law, what were its means? On this point, Durkheim observed, the Germans were indeed unanimous: “All,” he noted approvingly, “make of constraint the external condition of law” (1887b: 55). The later criticism of Georges Sorel notwithstanding (Lukes 1972: 12—14), the conception of constraint Durkheim found in Ihering seems to have been relatively differentiated: “[T]here are various kinds of constraint,” Durkheim observed, including that exercised by one individual on another; that exercised by an entire society under the form of manners, custom, and opinion; and that organized and concentrated in the hands of the State. “It is the last kind which assures the realization of law,” he observed. “Where it is not present, there is no law, and it is all the more inconsistent as it is the less well organized” (1887b: 55). But how does this organized, concentrated form of constraint work? What renders it efficacious? What motives, in short, lead people to respect the law? “No doubt,” Ihering admitted, “the most general and most powerful motive is self-interest, and it is to self-interest above all that the constraint exercised by the State is addressed.'' Yet, however necessary, the dictates of self-interest were clearly not sufficient: “In order for society to be possible,” Ihering and Durkheim again agreed, there had to be some “disinterested sentiment” — specifically, the inclinations of love (die Ltebe) and duty (Pflichtgefuhb) which, transcending the sphere of law, belonged to that of pure morality (die Sittlichkeit). Without such a pure morality, therefore, no law could exist.

如果这是法律的终结，那意味着什么？在这一点上，迪尔凯姆观察到，德国人确实是一致的: “所有的,”他赞许地指出，“使约束的外部条件的法律”(1887b: 55)。尽管后来对乔治 · 索雷尔的批评(路加福音1972:12ー14) ，迪尔凯姆在 Ihering 发现的约束的概念似乎已经有了相对的区别: “这里有各种各样的约束,”迪尔凯姆观察到，包括个人对另一个人的约束，整个社会在礼仪、习俗和意见的形式下的约束，以及在国家手中组织和集中的约束。“这是保证法律实现的最后一种,”他说。“没有法律的地方就没有法律，而组织较差的地方就更不一致了”(1887b: 55)。但是这种有组织的、集中的约束形式是如何工作的呢？是什么让它有效？简而言之，是什么动机促使人们尊重法律？“毫无疑问,”伊赫林承认，“最普遍、最有力的动机是自身利益，国家行使的约束首先是为了自身利益。”然而，无论多么必要，自我利益的要求显然是不够的: “为了使社会成为可能,”伊赫林和涂尔干再次同意，必须有一些“无私的情感”ーー具体来说，爱的倾向(die Ltebe)和责任(Pflickhtgefuhb) ，它们超越了法律的范围，属于纯粹的道德(die Sittlichkeit)。因此，没有这样一种纯粹的道德，就不可能存在法律。

Efficacious legal statutes thus presuppose an infrastructure of common moral sentiment; and even though ethics and law thus pursue the same goal (of making society possible) by the same means (constraint), Durkheim was clearly pleased by Ihering's emphasis on the more flexible, capacious, and ultimately transcendent realm of ethics: “[T]his constraint,” Durkheim agreed, “does not consist in an exterior, mechanical pressure, but rather has a more intimate, psychological character. It is not the State which exercises it, but the whole society.” Repeating his earlier objection to the Kathedersozia-listen, Durkheim insisted that the State “is too large a mechanism to regulate such complex movements of the human heart.” Ihering, Durkheim concluded, “has performed a great service to ethics by definitively integrating it with the study of customs ... an idea that Wundt has just taken up again” (1887b: 56—8).

因此，有效的法律法规预先假定了共同道德情感的基础结构; 即使伦理学和法律因此通过相同的手段(约束)追求相同的目标(使社会成为可能) ，迪尔凯姆显然对伊赫林强调更灵活、更宽容和最终超越的伦理学领域感到高兴: “[ T ]他的约束,”迪尔凯姆同意，“不在于外部的机械压力，而是有一个更亲密的心理特征。不是国家行使它，而是整个社会。”迪尔凯姆重申了他早些时候对凯瑟琳的反对意见，他坚持认为国家“是一个太大的机制，无法调节如此复杂的人类心脏运动。”迪尔凯姆总结道，伊赫林“通过明确地将伦理学与习俗研究结合起来，为伦理学做出了巨大贡献... ... 冯特刚刚重新接受了这个观点”(1887b: 56ー8)。

The second representative of historical jurisprudence in whom Durkheim expressed interest was Albert-Hermann Post (1839—95). As a positivist and empiricist interested in primitive forms of law, ethics, and the family, Post had attempted to construct a system of “ethnological jurisprudence,” a universal history of law culminating in deterministically conceived, evolutionary goals. In 1887 Durkheim’s primary concern was with Post’s Die Grundlagen des Rechts und die Grundzuge seiner Entwickelungsgeschichte (1884); and his judgment, which focused entirely on Post’s historical method, was largely negative: “ . . . the science of morals,’’ Durkheim insisted, “must not be confused with the history of morals, from which it draws its content. To describe the evolution of an idea or of an institution is not to explain it. When we know in what order the phases that it goes through succeed one another, we still know neither what its cause nor its function are’’ (1887b: 282).

迪尔凯姆感兴趣的历史法理学的第二位代表是阿尔伯特-赫尔曼 · 波斯特(1839-95)。作为一个对法律、伦理和家庭的原始形式感兴趣的实证主义者和经验主义者，波斯特试图构建一个“民族法学”体系，这是一个普遍的法律历史，以确定性的构想和进化目标达到顶点。1887年，迪尔凯姆主要关注的是波斯特的《法律和发展史的基本原则》(Die Grundlagen des Rechts und Die Grundzuge seiner Entwickelungseschichte，1884) ; 他的判断，完全集中在波斯特的历史方法上，大部分是负面的: “ ... ... 道德的科学,”迪尔凯姆坚持说，“不能与道德的历史混淆，道德的历史是它的内容来源。描述一种思想或一种制度的演变并不是解释它。当我们知道它经历的各个阶段以什么顺序相继发生时，我们仍然不知道它的起因和功能是什么”(1887b: 282)。

But just a year later, Durkheim spoke of Ihering and Post in the same breath, as juristic counterparts of Wagner and Schmoller. “Though they belonged to very different philosophical schools,’’ Durkheim observed, Ihering and Post “both tried to induce the general principles of law from the comparison of texts on laws and customs,’’ and thus “discovered the subject matter for a new science in law.’’ Political economy and jurisprudence thus comprised a “double movement, economic and legal,’’ which rendered an inestimable service to the development of sociology: “From that point on,’’ Durkheim insisted, “sociology ceased to be a kind of universal science, general and confused, including just about everything. It was divided into a certain number of special sciences which attacked ever more determinate problems. The study of political economy had long since been established, even though it had long been languishing. The science of law, though newer, was basically but a transformation of the old philosophy of law. Sociology,’’ Durkheim concluded, “thanks to its relationship to these two sciences, lost that erstwhile air of sudden improvisation which had sometimes cast doubt upon its future’’ (1888: 60-1).

但仅仅一年之后，迪尔凯姆就像法学界的瓦格纳和施莫勒一样，同时提到了伊林和波斯特。迪尔凯姆指出，“尽管他们属于非常不同的哲学流派,”伊赫林和波斯特“都试图从法律和习俗的文本比较中归纳出法律的一般原则,”从而“发现了法律新科学的主题。”因此，政治经济学和法理学构成了“经济学和法律学的双重运动”，为社会学的发展提供了不可估量的服务: “从那时起,”涂尔干坚持认为，“社会学不再是一种普遍的科学，普遍而混乱，包括几乎所有的东西。它被划分为一定数量的特殊科学，用来解决更加确定的问题。政治经济学的研究早已确立，尽管长期以来一直处于停滞状态。法学虽然较新，但基本上是旧法哲学的转变。涂尔干总结道，“由于社会学与这两门科学的关系，它失去了过去那种即兴发挥的气氛，这种气氛有时会使人对它的未来产生怀疑”(1888:60-1)。

The failure of French sociology also provided the context for Durkheim’s growing interest in German ethnography. Comte, Durkheim acknowledged, had given sociology an object to study -Society. But in a sense, he added, “Society’’ does not exist; only “societies’’ exist, in all their varieties, types, and species. “An adversary of Lamarck,’’ Durkheim observed, Comte “did not think it possible that the mere fact of evolution could differentiate organisms to the point of giving birth to new species. According to him, social facts are always and everywhere the same, with variations in intensity, while social development is always and everywhere the same, with variations in rate. The most savage nations and the most cultivated peoples,” Comte had thus concluded, “are but different phases of a single and identical evolution, and it was the laws of this unique evolution which he sought.” This explains Comte’s use of the terms “society” and “humanity” as if they were synonymous, Durkheim added, as well as his exclusive focus on civilized, German-Latin peoples (1888: 52-3).

法国社会学的失败也为迪尔凯姆对德国民族志日益增长的兴趣提供了背景。迪尔凯姆承认，孔德给了社会学一个研究对象——社会。但是在某种意义上，他补充说，“社会”并不存在; 只有“社会”存在，在它们所有的变种、类型和物种中。迪尔凯姆观察到，“拉马克的对手,”孔德“不认为仅仅进化的事实就可以区分有机体，从而产生新的物种。他认为，社会事实总是处处相同，强度不同，而社会发展总是处处相同，速度不同。“最野蛮的民族和最有教养的民族,”孔德这样总结道，“不过是同一个进化过程中的不同阶段，他所追求的正是这种独特进化的规律。”这解释了孔德使用“社会”和“人性”这两个词，好像他们是同义词，迪尔凯姆补充说，以及他对文明的，德国-拉丁民族的独家关注(1888:52-3)。

Comte had been encouraged in this perspective, Durkheim admitted, by the imperfect state of the ethnological sciences in his day; but today, Durkheim insisted, “it is manifestly impossible to maintain that there is a human evolution which is everywhere identical and that societies are all just different versions of a single and identical type’’ (1888: 53). Zoology had long ago renounced the linear classification, insisting instead that the genealogical descent of organized beings was “a very bushy tree whose branches, issuing haphazardly all along the trunk, shoot out capriciously in all directions. And it is the same,’’ Durkheim insisted, “with society.’’ Pascal’s formulation notwithstanding, “humanity” could hardly be compared “to a solitary man who has lived all these past centuries and still survives. Rather, [humanity] resembles an immense family, the various branches of which, as they diverge more and more from one another, gradually detach themselves from the common source to live their own lives’’ (1888: 54). The comparison of various societal types, Durkheim concluded, might still yield general laws applying to all societies; but such laws would never be revealed by even the most attentive observation of a single, isolated type.

迪尔凯姆承认，在他那个时代，人种学的不完美状态鼓舞了孔德，但是今天，迪尔凯姆坚持认为，“显然不可能坚持认为，人类的进化在任何地方都是相同的，社会只是一个单一和相同类型的不同版本”(1888:53)。动物学很久以前就放弃了线性分类，坚持认为有组织生物的谱系是“一种非常茂密的树，它的枝条随意地沿着树干向四面八方伸展。涂尔干坚持认为，“社会也是如此。”尽管有帕斯卡的说法，“人性”很难被比作“一个孤独的人，他活了这么多个世纪，现在仍然活着。”。相反，[人类]类似于一个巨大的家庭，其中各个分支，因为他们彼此分歧越来越多，逐渐脱离共同的来源，过自己的生活”(1888:54)。迪尔凯姆总结说，对各种社会类型的比较，可能仍然会产生适用于所有社会的一般规律; 但是即使是对单一的、孤立的类型进行最仔细的观察，也永远无法揭示这些规律。

The foundations for such a comparative study of societal types, Durkheim suggested, had been laid at “the dawn of the century’’ by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767—1835). Prussian statesman, humanist and linguist, older brother of the scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, friend of Schiller and Goethe, and founder of the university of Berlin, Humboldt’s early education had been in Greek, philosophy, natural law and classical political economy. During his university years at Frankfurt an der Oder (1787) and Gottingen (1788—9), however, Humboldt had begun to question the rationalistic presuppositions of the Enlightenment: “Like Herder,’’ one scholar has observed, Humboldt increasingly viewed human society “as a manifold of organic forces, closer to nature than to reason, and came to believe that true knowledge of humanity depended on the cultivation not of pure analytical reason but of deep-lying intuitive faculties” ± ideas that found expression in Uber das Studium des Altertums und des griechischen insbesondere (1793), Plan einer vergleichenden Anthropologie (1797), and Die Aufgabe des Geschichtschreibers (1821). To establish the unity of the human spirit asserted in these works, Durkheim argued, scholars like J. C. Prichard (1786—1848) and Gustav Klemm (1802—67) were inevitably led to the classi®cation and comparison of human civilizations, races, and languages (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1982: 199).

迪尔凯姆认为，这种社会类型比较研究的基础是由威廉·冯·洪堡(1767-1835)在“世纪之初”奠定的。普鲁士政治家、人文主义者和语言学家、科学家和探险家亚历山大·冯·洪堡的哥哥、席勒和歌德的朋友、柏林大学的创始人。洪堡早期的教育涉及希腊、哲学、自然法和古典政治经济学。然而，在奥得河畔法兰克福(1787年)和 Gottingen (1788-9年)的大学时代，洪堡开始质疑启蒙运动的理性主义预设: “像牧人一样,”一位学者观察到，洪堡越来越多地把人类社会视为“一种多种有机力量，更接近自然而非理性，并开始相信，人类真正的知识依赖于培养，而不是纯粹的分析理性，而是深层次的直觉能力。”(1793),比较人类学的计划(1797)和历史作家的任务(1821)。为了建立这些著作中所主张的人类精神的统一，迪尔凯姆认为，像 J · C · 普里查德(1786-1848)和古斯塔夫 · 克莱姆(1802-67)这样的学者不可避免地被引向对人类文明、种族和语言的分类和比较(迪尔凯姆和福康奈1982:199)。

Deploige’s “accusation” of 1905—7, however, referred more speci®cally to the German Volkerpsychologie, the collective product of a group of anthropologists cum psychologists led by Theodor Waitz (1821—64), Heymann Steinthal (1823—99), and Moritz Lazarus (1824—1903), whose works had been introduced to French audiences through Ribot’s La Psychologie allemande contemporaine (1879). Waitz, the son of a clergyman and seminary director, had studied at Leipzig, published a critical edition of Aristotle’s Organon (1844) and, in 1846, joined the philosophy faculty at the university of Marburg. Deeply indebted to Herbartian psychology, Waitz’s early works sought to reconcile an empirical study of the human mind with his utterly devout religious beliefs. But it was his Anthropologie der Naturvolker (6 vols., 1859—72), initially conceived as the empirical foundation for a philosophy of religion, which provided much of the (admittedly rather meager) ethnographic substance of De la division du travail social (1893) (1984: 89—90, 97, 103, 128—9, 134, 189). The Anthropologie der Naturvolker, Durkheim observed in 1903, “synthesized the ethnographical and anthropological labours of a whole era’’ — thus completing the “early, descriptive” stage of ethnographic research (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1982: 199).

然而，德普洛伊奇1905-1907年的“指控”更具体地提到了德国沃尔克心理学，这是由西奥多 · 韦茨(Theodor Waitz，1821-1864)、海曼 · 斯坦塔尔(Heymann Steinthal，1823-1899)和莫里茨 · 拉扎勒斯(Moritz Lazarus，1824-1903)领导的一群人类学家和心理学家共同创作的作品，他们的作品通过里伯特的《德国当代心理学》(La Psychology logie allemande Contemporary poraine，1879)被介绍给法国观众。韦茨是一位牧师和神学院院长的儿子，曾就读于莱比锡大学，出版了《亚里士多德的奥伽农》(1844)的批判性版本，并于1846年加入了马尔堡大学的哲学系。韦茨的早期作品深受赫尔巴特心理学的影响，试图调和人类心理的实证研究与他完全虔诚的宗教信仰。但正是他的《自然人类学》(1859-72年第6卷) ，最初被认为是宗教哲学的经验主义基础，它提供了社会劳动分工(1893)(1984:89-90,97,103,128-9,134,189)的大部分人种学实质(诚然相当微薄)。涂尔干在1903年观察到的《自然人类学》“综合了整个时代的人种学和人类学劳动”，从而完成了人种学研究的“早期，描述性”阶段(涂尔干和福康奈1982:199)。

According to Ribot, the most signi®cant contribution of Lazarus and Steinthal to the social sciences was the feitschriftfur Volkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft. Founded in 1859, the feitschrift had declared its intention to publish essays concerned with “the discovery of the laws of ethnic psychology,” reports of “historical, ethnological, geological, and anthropological facts,’’ and to study language “not as the philologist or the empirical linguist, but in order to discover, with the aid of physiology, the psychological laws of language’’ — a “noble program, well-de®ned,’’ Ribot suggested in 1886, although one which remained largely unfulfilled. “In addition to ordinary psychology, which deals with individual man,’’ Ribot explained, “there is room for another science, devoted to social man, or, more exactly, to groups of men.” This is what the Zeitschrift intends by the phrase “ethnic” or “ethnological” psychology. But the successful realization of such a science, he immediately added, depends upon certain theoretical presuppositions; and it was these presuppositions which would appear to Deploige as the sources of much of Durkheim’s sociology (1886: 60—1).

里伯特认为，拉扎勒斯和斯坦塔尔对社会科学最重要的贡献是《沃尔克心理学和语言学》。成立于1859年的费特斯克里夫特宣布，它打算发表与“种族心理学规律的发现”有关的文章，关于“历史、民族学、地质学和人类学事实”的报告，并研究语言“不是作为语言学家或经验主义语言学家，而是为了借助生理学的帮助发现语言的心理规律”ーー一个“高尚的程序，很好”，里伯特在1886年提出，尽管这个程序在很大程度上还没有实现。里伯特解释说: “除了普通的心理学研究个人之外，还有另一种科学研究社会人的空间，或者更确切地说，研究群体人的空间。”这就是《时代周刊》用“种族”或“民族学”心理学这个词所要表达的意思。但是，他立即补充说，这种科学的成功实现取决于某些理论预设; 正是这些预设似乎德普洛伊作为迪尔凯姆社会学的大部分来源(1886:60ー1)。

For ethnological psychology to have a “real object,’’ Ribot observed, it must be proved that the study of the individual alone is insufficient. The essential condition of this proof is the demonstration that “society” is a whole greater than the sum of its individual parts: “If it be true,’’ Ribot thus suggested, “that the social whole is something else than a simple addition of individuals, if the formation of groups gives birth to new relations, to new forms of development; briefly, if the whole be not an arithmetical sum of units, but a chemical combination differing from its elements, it must be admitted that Volkerpsychologie has a province exclusively its own. And this,’’ Ribot then added in a most Durkheimian manner, “is the truth. The social whole differs as much from each of its parts as the laws of political economy differ from the principles of domestic economy urged by a father upon his son, by a teacher upon his ward.’’ The individual tree, Lazarus had observed, constitutes a legitimate object of study for the botanist; but ®fty thousand trees make a forest, and this forest becomes the object of another science altogether, “a science which rests without doubt on the physiology of plant life, but which has, nevertheless, an end and means of its own’’ (1886: 61—2). The “real object’’ of ethnological psychology was precisely this Volksgeist, this “spirit of a people’’ independent of its individual members.

Ribot 观察到，要使民族心理学有一个“真实的对象”，就必须证明仅仅对个体进行研究是不够的。这个证明的基本条件是证明“社会”是一个整体，大于它的个别部分的总和: “如果这是真的,”里伯特因此建议，“社会整体不是简单的个人的增加，如果群体的形成产生新的关系，新的发展形式; 简而言之，如果整体不是一个单位的算术总和，而是一个化学组合不同于它的元素，它必须承认沃尔克心理学有一个省专属自己的。而这,”里伯特接着以一种最涂尔干海姆式的方式补充道，“就是真相。社会整体与其各个部分之间的差异，正如政治经济规律与父亲对儿子、教师对被监护人所敦促的家庭经济原则之间的差异一样大。”拉扎勒斯观察到，个别的树木构成了植物学家合法的研究对象; 但是五万棵树组成了一个森林，而这个森林完全成了另一门科学的对象，“一门毫无疑问依赖于植物生命的生理学的科学，但是它有它自己的目的和手段”(1886:61ー2)。民族心理学的“真正对象”正是这个“人民精神”，这个独立于其个别成员的“人民精神”。

What is the nature of this Volksgeist? And whence does it come? To such questions, Ribot observed, Lazarus and Steinthal “reply in a rather mystical style, that ‘it is not a substance, but a subject’; that it is ‘a monad that penetrates and combines individuals’; that it is an ‘objective spirit.’ In other words,’’ Ribot explained, “whenever men form a group, live together, constitute a society, there arises from the consensus of individual (subjective) spirits a common (objective) spirit, ‘which becomes at once the expression, the law, the organ of the subjective spirit’ ’’ (1886: 63). The elements of this common, objective spirit (including language, mythology, religion, culture, art, custom, law, etc.), as well as their development, interaction, growth and decline, constituted the work of ethnological psychology. But however “noble” and “well-de®ned” the program of the feitschrift, Ribot felt that Lazarus and Steinthal had not succeeded. Admittedly, they had produced a number of documents on attractive subjects (e.g., the history of religions, literary criticism, linguistics, anthropology, the history of customs, law, and politics); but their treatment seemed “as much literary as scienti®c,'' “too general for this kind of investigation,” and lacking in “exact results” (1886: 64—6). The English anthropologists, by contrast, “have apprehended better the conditions of a psychology of the races. They have sketched it in monographs” — e.g., Lubbock's and McLennan's studies of the primitive family, and Tylor's Primitive Culture (1871) (1886: 66—7).

这个人民精神是什么？它从何而来？对于这些问题，Ribot 观察到，Lazarus 和 Steinthal“以一种相当神秘的风格回答，‘它不是一个物质，而是一个主体’; 它是‘一个穿透并结合个体的单体’; 它是一个‘客观的精神。“换句话说,”里伯特解释道，“当人们组成一个群体，共同生活，构成一个社会时，个人(主观)精神的共识就会产生一种共同(客观)精神，‘这种精神立即成为主观精神的表达、法律和器官’”(1886:63)。这种共同的、客观的精神要素(包括语言、神话、宗教、文化、艺术、风俗、法律等) ，以及它们的发展、互动、成长和衰落，构成了民族心理学的工作。但是，无论纪念文字的程序是多么“高尚”和“完美”，里伯特认为拉扎勒斯和斯坦塔尔并没有成功。不可否认，他们已经制作了许多有吸引力的主题的文件(例如，宗教史，文学批评，语言学，人类学，风俗史，法律和政治) ; 但是他们的处理似乎“文学和科学一样多”，“对于这种调查来说太笼统”，缺乏“确切的结果”(1886:64ー6)。相比之下，英国人类学家“更好地理解了种族心理的状况。他们在专著中对此进行了概述”ーー例如，拉伯克和麦克伦南对原始家庭的研究，以及泰勒的《原始文化》(1871)(1886:66ー7)。

By 1888, Durkheim had reached largely similar conclusions. “In every society,” he observed, “there exists a certain number of common ideas and sentiments. These are passed from one generation to another and simultaneously assure the unity and the continuity of collective life. Among these are popular legends, religious traditions, political beliefs, language, and so on. All these phenomena are psychological in nature, but they do not have their source in individual psychology, since they in®nitely transcend the individual. They must, therefore, be the object of a special science charged with their description and the investigation of their preconditions. This science could be called social psychology. This,'' Durkheim added, referring explicitly to Lazarus and Steinthal, “is the Germans' Volkerpsychologie.” The difficulty for Durkheim, as for Ribot, was that “no results have yet been produced'' (1888: 63). By the time results were produced, Durkheim's estimate of their signi®cance had been deeply colored by the comparative — and largely British — study of religion. “Armed with the theory of survivals,'' Durkheim wrote in 1903, Mannhardt, Tylor, Lang, W. R. Smith, Frazer, Hartland, and Wilken “annexed at a stroke for the comparative science of religions the whole body of facts relating to folklore or Volkskunde which the Germans had observed, recorded and compared since the beginning of the century, and which thereby took on a new signi®cance. The agricultural customs of our countries, magical practices, ideas concerning the dead, tales and legends, all appeared to be the residue of ancient cults and beliefs. Thus the religions of the most highly cultured societies and those of the lowest tribes,'' he concluded, “were linked, each serving mutually to explain the other'' (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1982: 200).

到了1888年，涂尔干得出了大致相同的结论。“在每个社会中,”他说，“都存在着一定数量的共同思想和感情。它们代代相传，同时保证了集体生活的统一性和连续性。其中包括流行传说、宗教传统、政治信仰、语言等等。所有这些现象在本质上都是心理学的，但它们在个体心理学中没有根源，因为它们在根本上是超越个体的。因此，它们必须成为一门特殊科学的研究对象，这门科学负责描述和研究它们的先决条件。这门科学可以称为社会心理学。迪尔凯姆明确提到了拉扎勒斯和斯坦塔尔，他补充道: “这就是德国人的沃尔克心理学。”迪尔凯姆和里伯特的困难在于“还没有产生任何结果”(1888:63)。到研究结果出来的时候，涂尔干对它们意义的估计已经被对宗教的比较研究(主要是英国的研究)深深地影响了。迪尔凯姆在1903年写道: “用生存理论武装起来,”Mannhardt、泰勒、朗、 W · R · 史密斯、弗雷泽、哈特兰和威尔肯“为了宗教比较科学，一下子吞并了德国人自本世纪初以来观察、记录和比较的与民俗或人民有关的全部事实，因此具有了新的意义。我们各国的农业习俗、巫术、死亡观念、神话传说等，似乎都是古代邪教和信仰的残余。因此，最有文化修养的社会和最底层的部落的宗教,”他总结道，“是相互联系的，每个部落都互相服务以解释对方”(迪尔凯姆和福康奈1982:200)。

Political economy, jurisprudence, and ethnography: “[w]hat emerged from all these investigations,” Durkheim summarized, “was the fact that social phenomena could no longer be deemed the product of fortuitous combinations, arbitrary acts of the will, or local chance circumstances. Their generality attests to their essential dependence on general causes which, everywhere that they are present, produce their effects.” Beneath “what was once held to be the preponderant influence of princes, statesmen, legislators and men of genius of every kind,” historians were increasingly discovering these “impersonal forces” which dominate historical processes. “[I]t is not we who think,” Durkheim agreed with Post, “but the world which thinks in us.” Morals, customs, even the art and literature of a society were the unconscious work of the peoples themselves; and “if peoples have their own ways of thinking and feeling,” Durkheim concluded, then “this life of the intellect can become an object of scientific study, just as that of individuals” (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1982: 201).

政治经济学、法理学和人种学: 涂尔干总结道: “从所有这些调查中得出的结论是，社会现象不能再被视为偶然组合、意志的任意行为或当地偶然情况的产物。它们的普遍性证明了它们对普遍原因的本质依赖，而普遍原因无论在哪里都会产生影响。”在“曾经被认为是王子、政治家、立法者和各种天才人物的主导影响力”之下，历史学家们越来越多地发现了这些支配历史进程的“非个人力量”。涂尔干同意波斯特的观点，“不是我们在思考，而是这个世界在思考我们。”道德，风俗，甚至社会的艺术和文学都是人们自己的无意识的工作; “如果人们有他们自己的思维和感觉方式,”涂尔干总结道，“那么这种智力生活可以成为科学研究的对象，就像个人一样”(涂尔干和福康奈1982:201)。

The extent of Durkheim’s debt to German sociology is more difficult to ascertain. Durkheim’s early resistance to Gumplowicz’s social realism has already been noted. After 1887, however, Durkheim’s objections to German sociology sometimes suggested they were not realist enough. In his 1889 review of Ferdinand Tonnies’ Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), for example, Durkheim praised the characterizations of both Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, and agreed with the German author that these were indeed the two great societal types. Against Tonnies, however, Durkheim insisted that the modern, Gesellschaft type “is every bit as natural as that of small aggregates. It is neither less organic nor less self-contained. Aside from purely individual activities, there is in our contemporary societies a truly collective activity which is just as natural as that of the less extensive societies of former times’’ (1978b: 121). And in a manner consistent with his earlier praise of the Kathedersozialisten, Durkheim objected to Tonnies’ focus on abstract concepts rather than concrete social realities: “The only way to succeed,’’ Durkheim argued, “would have been to proceed inductively, that is, to study Gesellschaft through the laws and mores which are associated with it and which reveal its structure’’ (1978b: 121-2).

迪尔凯姆欠德国社会学的债务程度更难确定。涂尔干早期对甘普洛维奇的社会现实主义的抵制已经被注意到了。然而，1887年以后，迪尔凯姆对德国社会学的反对有时表明他们不够现实。例如，在他1889年对费迪南德 · 托尼斯的《社会和社会》(Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft，1887)的评论中，涂尔干赞扬了对社会和社会的描述，并且同意德国作者的观点，认为这两种社会类型确实是两种伟大的社会类型。然而，对于托尼斯，涂尔干坚持认为，现代的格塞尔沙夫特类型“与小集合体一样自然。它既不缺乏有机性，也不缺乏独立性。除了纯粹的个人活动之外，在我们的当代社会中还有一种真正的集体活动，这种活动与以前那些不那么广泛的社会一样自然”(1978b: 121)。与他早期对 Kathedersozialisten 的赞美一致，迪尔凯姆反对托尼关注抽象概念而不是具体的社会现实: “成功的唯一途径,”迪尔凯姆认为，“将是进行归纳，也就是说，通过与之相关的法律和道德来研究社会，并揭示其结构”(1978b: 121-2)。

Durkheim had similar objections to the views of Georg Simmel, whose works he and Paul Fauconnet discussed in a lengthy review article entitled “Sociologie et sciences sociales’’ (1903). According to Simmel, Durkheim observed, the distinction between the particular social sciences and sociology per se corresponds, respectively, to that between content (i.e., the various phenomena which occur between individuals in association) and the form that “contains” them (i.e., the association itself, within which these phenomena are observed). “The association,” Durkheim noted in summarizing Simmel’s position, “is the only expressly social thing, and sociology is the science of association in abstracto.’ Such a process of abstraction and classification, Durkheim admitted, is essential to science itself; but it must be carried out methodically, “in conformity with the nature of things’’ (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1982: 189—90, 191). For Durkheim, the difficulty with Simmel’s classification was thus the utterly metaphorical character of terms like “form” and “content,” which corresponded to nothing in nature itself; on the contrary, Durkheim argued, they simply described two aspects of social life, the one more general, the other more specific — but both equally “sociological.” In fact, he insisted, there is no way to determine the degree of generality a phenomenon must have for it to be considered “sociological” at all, a problem of indeterminacy characteristic not only of Simmel’s distinction but of his work as a whole: “The problems raised,’’ Durkheim concluded, “do not relate to determinate categories of facts: they are general themes for philosophical meditation’’ — but not for positive science (Durkheim and Fauconnet 1903: 190—4).

迪尔凯姆对乔治 · 西梅尔(Georg Simmel)的观点也有类似的反对意见，他和保罗 · 福康奈(Paul Fauconnet)在一篇题为《社会学与社会科学》(Sociologie et Sciences sociales，1903)的长篇评论文章中讨论了西梅尔的作品。根据西梅尔的观察，迪尔凯姆观察到，特定社会科学和社会学本身之间的区别，分别对应于内容(即，个体之间联想发生的各种现象)和“包含”它们的形式(即，联想本身，在其中观察到这些现象)之间的区别。迪尔凯姆在总结西梅尔的观点时指出: “社会联想是唯一明确的社会事物，而社会学是抽象的联想科学。”。涂尔干承认，这种抽象和分类的过程对于科学本身是必不可少的; 但是它必须有条不紊地进行，“符合事物的本质”(涂尔干和福康奈1982:189ー90,191)。对于迪尔凯姆来说，西梅尔分类法的困难在于，“形式”和“内容”这样的术语完全是隐喻性的，它们与自然本身没有任何关系; 相反，迪尔凯姆认为，它们只是描述了社会生活的两个方面，一个更普遍，另一个更具体，但两者都是同样的“社会学”事实上，他坚持认为，没有办法确定一种现象必须具有的普遍性程度，才能被认为是“社会学的”，这是一个不确定性的问题，不仅仅是西梅尔的区别，而且是他作为一个整体的工作特点: “提出的问题,”涂尔干总结说，“与确定的事实类别无关: 它们是哲学冥想的一般主题”ーー但不是实证科学(涂尔干和福康奈1903:190ー4)。

Among German sociologists, therefore, the most prominent place must belong to Schaeffle. A rationalist, socialist, and ardent antiindividualist, Schaeffle rose rapidly to a professorship at the university of Tubingen and became a member of the Wurttemberg diet. He later occupied a chair at the university of Vienna while editing the feitschriftfur die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, and by the late 1870s was among the German sociologists of greatest interest to French writers. As we have seen, Espinas discussed Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben des sozialen Korpers (4 vols., 1875—78) in the second edition of Les Societes animales (1878), Fouillee discussed the same work again in La Science sociale contemporaine (1880), and in 1885, Durkheim’s first published work had been a review of the first volume of Bau und Leben for the Revue philosophique.

因此，在德国社会学家中，最突出的地方一定属于 Schaeffle。谢弗是一个理性主义者、社会主义者和狂热的反个人主义者，他迅速升任 Tubingen 大学的教授，并成为 Wurttemberg 饮食的一员。后来，他在维也纳大学担任主席，同时编辑《国家科学》 ，到19世纪70年代末，他成为法国作家最感兴趣的德国社会学家之一。正如我们所看到的，埃斯皮纳斯在《动物社会》(1878)第二版中讨论了舍费尔的《社会的工作与生活》(1875-78第4卷) ，傅利在《当代社会科学》(1880)中再次讨论了同样的作品，1885年，涂尔干的第一部出版作品是对《哲学评论》第一卷《社会的工作与生活》的评论。

Schaeffle argued, for example,

例如，舍弗认为,

Human society is a living organism of a peculiar kind. The social body works through and for its active components . . . but it maintains itself above these as a continuous collective conscience with a tradition of spiritual and material properties governing these individuals ... It is not an organism in the biological sense. In an empirical sense, it is an independent entity of a higher order . . . Society is not the sum of individuals. Its totality consists in the change of individuals and it outlasts generations of individuals and families. Social consciousness is more than the totality-content of individual consciousness. (1875: iff.; in Deploige, 1911: 124-5 n. 12)

人类社会是一种特殊的生命有机体。社会身体通过它的活动组成部分来工作... ... 但它作为一个持续的集体良知来维持它自己，这种良知具有支配这些个体的精神和物质属性的传统... ... 它不是生物学意义上的有机体。在经验意义上，它是一个更高层次的独立实体... ... 社会不是个人的总和。它的总体性在于个人的变化，它比一代代的个人和家庭更为持久。社会意识不仅仅是个体意识的总体内容。(1875: if. ; 在 Deploige，1911:124-5 n. 12)

“[T]his idea,’’ Durkheim observed in his “Cours de science sociale’’ (1978), “without which sociology cannot exist, has always been very much alive in Germany, and was eclipsed only during the brief period when Kantian individualism held undisputed sway. The Germans have too profound a sense for the complexity of things to be easily content with so simplistic a solution. The theory which compares society with living organisms was therefore well received in Germany because it permitted the German to become more fully aware of an idea which had long been dear to them. Schaeffle,’’ he concluded quite accurately, “accepts it without hesitation” (1978a: 59).

迪尔凯姆在他的《社会科学课程》(1978)中写道: “他的观点，没有它社会学就不可能存在，在德国一直非常活跃，只是在康德个人主义无可争议地占据主导地位的短暂时期才黯然失色。德国人对事物的复杂性有着深刻的认识，不会轻易满足于如此简单的解决方案。因此，将社会与生命有机体进行比较的理论在德国广受欢迎，因为它使德国人能够更充分地认识到他们长期以来所珍视的一个观念。谢弗,”他相当准确地总结道，“毫不犹豫地接受它”(1978a: 59)。

Like the Kathedersozialisten, Schaeffle was an avowed critic of liberalism, insisting that “liberty and equality must not be promoted at the expense of order, unity, and association, because in this event they would bring about weakness instead of power, suicide instead of self-preservation of the whole’’ (1875: 134ff.; in Deploige 1911: 140). But unlike the Kathedersozialisten, Schaeffle shared Durkheim’s view of the insufficiency and even danger of State intervention as a remedy for liberal anarchy. The “excessive plasticity” which Wagner and Schmoller attributed to law and ethics, Durkheim observed, is denied by Schaeffle, who rather views society as “a living being which is moved from within. The legislator does not invent laws, he can only confirm them and form them with clarity. . . The legislator does not play in their formation the exorbitant role that the socialists of the chair sometimes assign him, and his importance diminishes proportionately as that of society grows.’’ It was in this sense that Schaeffle “was the first to extract the moral consequences of the work of the political economists, without making their mistakes’’ (1887b: 47, 45).

像 Kathedersozialisten 一样，舍费尔公开批评自由主义，坚持认为“自由和平等不能以牺牲秩序、团结和结合为代价来促进，因为在这种情况下，它们会导致软弱而不是权力，自杀而不是整体自我保存”(1875:134 ff)。; 在 Deploige 1911:140)。但与 Kathedersozialisten 不同的是，舍费尔赞同涂尔干的观点，即国家干预作为自由主义无政府状态的补救措施是不充分的，甚至是危险的。迪尔凯姆观察到，瓦格纳和施莫勒认为法律和伦理具有“过度的可塑性”，但谢弗否认了这种可塑性，他认为社会是“一个从内部移动的生命体”。立法者不是法律的创造者，他只能确认法律，然后清晰地形成法律... ... 立法者在法律形成过程中不会扮演主席的社会主义者有时赋予他的过分角色，他的重要性随着社会的发展而成比例地降低。”正是在这个意义上，舍费尔“是第一个提取出政治经济学家工作的道德后果，而不犯他们的错误”(1887b: 47,45)。

So skeptical of State intervention, Schaeffle called for the restoration ± albeit under a new form ± of the occupational corporations of the Middle Ages: “The corporation,” he insisted, “is a need of all times, of the present as well as of the future. However, it has special forms in every period of history’’ (1875: 757—65; in Deploige 1911: 140—1). In Le Suicide (1897), Durkheim too would call for a restoration of the medieval guilds, outside of (though subject to) the State, which would perform social functions (e.g., the supervision of insurance, welfare, and pensions; the settling of contractual disputes; the regulation of working conditions; etc.) as well as moral functions: “Besides the rights and duties common to all men,” Durkheim explained, “there are others depending on qualities peculiar to each occupation, the number of which increases in importance as occupational activity increasingly develops and diversihes. For each of these special disciplines, an equally special organ is needed, to apply and maintain it” (1951: 380).

由于对国家干预持怀疑态度，舍费尔呼吁恢复中世纪职业公司的形式: “公司,”他坚持说，“是现在和未来所有时代的需要。然而，它在历史的每一个时期都有其特殊的形式”(1875:757ー65; 在 Deploige 1911:140ー1)。在《自杀》(1897)一书中，迪尔凯姆也呼吁恢复中世纪的行会，在国家之外(尽管受制于) ，行会将履行社会职能(例如，监督保险、福利和养老金; 解决合同纠纷; 调节工作条件等)以及道德职能: “除了所有人共有的权利和义务,”迪尔凯姆解释说，“还有其他取决于每个职业特有的品质，其数量随着职业活动的日益发展和多样化而增加的重要性。对于这些特殊学科中的每一个，都需要一个同样特殊的机构来运用和维护它”(1951:380)。

Though a moralist, Schaeffle insisted that both law and ethics be studied in their empirical, social context rather than artihcially deduced. “Ethics,” Durkheim could thus write approvingly of Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben,

作为一个道德家，谢弗尔坚持认为，法律和伦理应该在其经验和社会背景下进行研究，而不是人为地进行推断。“伦理学”涂尔干因此可以赞同舍费尔的《建筑与生活》

is not a system of abstract rules that man finds written in his conscience or that the moralist deduces from the back of his closet. It is a social function, or rather a system of functions, which forms and consolidates itself little by little under the pressure of collective needs. Love in general, the abstract inclination to disinterestedness, does not exist. What really exists is love in marriage and in the family, the free self-devotion of friendship, the municipal spirit, patriotism, the love of humanity; and all these sentiments are the product of history. It is these concrete facts which form the content of morality. The moralist can thus neither invent nor construct them; but he must observe them where they exist, and then seek in society their causes and conditions. (1887b: 46—7)

不是人们在良心中找到的抽象规则，也不是道德家从壁橱后面推断出的规则。它是一种社会功能，或者说是一种功能系统，在集体需求的压力下逐渐形成和巩固自身。一般来说，爱这种抽象的无私倾向是不存在的。真正存在的是婚姻和家庭中的爱情、友谊的自由奉献、城市精神、爱国主义、人性之爱，这些情感都是历史的产物。正是这些具体的事实构成了道德的内容。因此，道德家既不能发明也不能建造它们; 但是他必须在它们存在的地方观察它们，然后在社会中寻找它们的原因和条件。(1887b: 46ー7)

Finally, Schaeffle had a vision of the method and organization of sociological study quite similar to the later Durkheim. He complained of the lack of integration of the special social sciences, while simultaneously rejecting the more comprehensive, but speculative and abstract philosophies of history and society characteristic of Comte and Spencer (1875: 52; in Deploige 1911: 129 n. 25). Admitting that the observations of individual scholars must always be fragmentary, incomplete, and reflective of personalities and prejudices, he advised the use of statistics, the study of historical documents, and the collection of ethnographic data; and “to disengage the causes of phenomena,’’ Schaeffle observed, following Mill, the sociologist should “prudently choose one of the four methods’’ — i.e., of concordances, differences, residues, or concomitant variations (1875: 124; in Deploige 1911: 130).

最后，谢弗对社会学研究的方法和组织有一个与后来的涂尔干非常相似的看法。他抱怨特殊社会科学缺乏整合，同时拒绝更全面，但思辨和抽象的历史哲学和社会的孔德和斯宾塞的特点(1875:52; 在 Deploige 1911:129 n. 25)。他承认，个别学者的观察必须总是支离破碎，不完整，反映个性和偏见，他建议使用统计学，研究历史文献，收集人种学数据; 以及“脱离现象的原因,”舍费尔观察到，在密尔之后，社会学家应该“谨慎地选择四种方法之一”ーー即，协调，差异，残留，或伴随的变化(1875:124; 在 Deploige 1911:130)。

Durkheim’s admiration for Schaeffle’s works was hardly unqualified. He argued that Schaeffle’s frequent use of biological analogues threatened to undermine the very independence which he had sought for sociology (1885a: 98—9). He complained that Schaeffle’s estimate of the role of consciousness and reason in society (ironically, the basis for Schaeffle’s insistence on the independence of sociology from biology) was not only exaggerated and the prerogative of an isolated elite, but would return society to the very anarchistic individualism which both Durkheim and Schaeffle abhorred (1885a: 99—100). Similarly, Durkheim found Schaeffle’s definition of ethics, which restricted moral actions to those resulting from a purely spontaneous movement of the will, narrow and imprecise (1887b: 46). The latter difficulties, in particular, Durkheim attributed to the unwholesome influence of German psychology, which had traditionally encouraged a discontinuity between the realms of Natur and Geist (1887b: 48). But Durkheim felt that the influence of Descartes had been equally unhealthy for the French, and that Schaeffle’s sociology was a practical, potential corrective: “. . . there are few readings more highly instructive for a Frenchman,’’ Durkheim said of Bau und Leben in 1885, for “[i]t is by the practice of such patient and laborious studies that we shall fortify our spirit, now too slender, too thin, too fond of simplicity. It is by learning to face the infinite complexity of facts that we free ourselves of those too narrow frameworks in which we tend to compartmentalize things. It is perhaps no exaggeration,” Durkheim concluded, “to say that the future worth of French sociology depends on this’’ (1885a: 97).

涂尔干对谢弗作品的赞赏几乎是毫无保留的。他认为谢弗尔频繁使用生物类似物威胁到了他所寻求的社会学独立性(1885a: 98ー9)。他抱怨说，谢弗尔对意识和理性在社会中的作用的估计(具有讽刺意味的是，这是谢弗尔坚持社会学独立于生物学的基础)不仅被夸大了，是一个孤立的精英的特权，而且会使社会回归到涂尔干和谢弗尔都憎恶的无政府主义的个人主义(1885a: 99ー100)。同样，迪尔凯姆发现谢弗尔的伦理学定义，它将道德行为限制在那些纯粹由意志自发运动产生的行为上，狭隘而不精确(1887b: 46)。后者的困难，特别是迪尔凯姆归因于德国心理学的不健康的影响，这传统上鼓励了 Natur 和盖斯特领域之间的不连续性(1887b: 48)。但涂尔干认为，笛卡尔对法国人的影响同样不健康，谢弗的社会学是一种实用的、潜在的纠正: “ ... ... 没有什么读物比这更能给法国人带来启发,”涂尔干在1885年谈到《包与勒本》(Bau und Leben)时表示，因为“正是通过这种耐心而艰苦的研究实践，我们才能巩固我们的精神，现在我们太苗条、太瘦弱、太喜欢简单了。”。正是通过学会面对事实的无限复杂性，我们才能从那些过于狭隘的框架中解脱出来，在这些框架中，我们倾向于将事物分割开来。迪尔凯姆总结道，“说法国社会学的未来价值取决于此，也许并不夸张”(1885a: 97)。

WUNDT AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY in GERMANY

德国的创伤与实验心理学

“After Kant,’’ Ribot observed, “metaphysic reigned in Germany for half a century, and all science of the phenomena of consciousness was forgotten or despised.’’ Even in the reaction which followed, “men continued to treat [psychology] as an illegitimate child of metaphysic, and wrote books which were epitomes of arti®cial, pro®tless, and insoluble questions; discarded altogether a positive basis of harmony, physical flux, occasionalism, materialism, and pantheism, in all their forms. Men seriously discussed the relative merit of ‘traducianism’ and ‘creationism.’ ’’ Yet even then, Ribot added, real scientists, “as it were by chance and through the study of details, were preparing for the birth of scientific psychology’’ (1886: 287).

“康德之后,”里伯特说，“形而上学在德国统治了半个世纪，所有关于意识现象的科学都被遗忘或鄙视。”即使在接下来的反应中，“人们继续把(心理学)当作形而上学的非婚生子女，写那些人为的、无关紧要的、无法解决的问题的缩影，完全抛弃了和谐、物理变化、偶然主义、唯物主义和泛神论的所有形式的积极基础。人们认真地讨论了‘传统主义’和‘神创论’的相对价值。”然而，Ribot 补充说，真正的科学家，“因为偶然和通过对细节的研究，正在为科学心理学的诞生做准备”(1886:287)。

For Ribot — as for most historians of experimental psychology — these preparatory labors began with Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776—1841), a student of Fichte, successor to Kant at Konigsberg, and professor of philosophy at the university of Gottingen. In his Lehrbuch zur Psychologie (1815) and especially Psychologie als Wissenschaft (1824—5), Herbart sought to establish a basis for psychology independent of the prevailing “faculty” psychology of Christian Wolff, by showing that the laws of mental processes could be expressed in precise mathematical form. Herbart “sets out from a priori principles,” Ribot complained, “gives little room to facts, [and] much to reasoning and mathematics”; but among Kant’s numerous disciples, he added, Herbart “alone . . . can be called a psychologist” (1886: 21).

对于里伯特(以及大多数实验心理学历史学家)来说，这些准备工作始于约翰·弗里德里希·赫尔巴特(1776-1841) ，他是 Fichte 的一名学生，是康德在 Konigsberg 的继任者，也是 Gottingen 大学的哲学教授。赫尔巴特在他的《心理学教程》(1815) ，特别是《心理学是科学》(1824-5)中，试图建立一个独立于克里斯蒂安 · 沃尔夫的主流“教员”心理学的心理学基础，通过表明心理过程的规律可以用精确的数学形式表达。里伯特抱怨称，赫尔巴特“从先验原理出发，给事实留下的空间很小，给推理和数学留下的空间很大”; 但他补充称，在康德众多的门徒中，赫尔巴特“独自... ... 可以被称为心理学家”(1886:21)。

At least equally important in the pre-history of experimental psychology was Johannes Muller (1801—58), a student and then professor at Bonn until called to the chair of anatomy and physiology at Berlin in 1833. This “post of great distinction,” Boring has observed, “served to mark Muller as the foremost authority on physiology of his day,’’ and his Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen (1833—40) became “the primary systematic treatise’’ (1950: 34). Herbart, meanwhile, had been succeeded at Gottingen by Rudolf Hermann Lotze (1817—81), whose Medizinische Psychologie (1852) became the first systematic work on physiological psychology. Although “employing experience,” Ribot again complained, Lotze in fact “never separated psychological researches from metaphysical hypotheses, and we can say without hesitation that the ‘psychology without a soul,’ which has gained a goodly number of adherents in Germany. . . never had his entire allegiance” (1886: 21).

至少在实验心理学史前史上同样重要的是约翰内斯 · 穆勒(Johannes Muller，1801-58) ，他是波恩大学的学生和教授，直到1833年被任命为柏林大学解剖学和生理学教授。这个“极具特色的职位,”Boring 评论道，“标志着 Muller 成为他那个时代最重要的生理学权威,”他的《人类生理学手册》(1833-40)成为“主要的系统论著”(1950:34)。与此同时，赫尔巴特在 Gottingen 的继任者是鲁道夫•赫尔曼•洛策(1817-81) ，他的《医学心理学》(1852)成为第一部系统研究生理心理学的著作。尽管“运用经验”，里伯特再次抱怨道，事实上，洛策“从未将心理学研究与形而上学假说分离开来，我们可以毫不犹豫地说，‘没有灵魂的心理学’在德国已经获得了相当多的追随者... ... 从未得到他的全部忠诚”(1886:21)。

As indicated above (see p. 120), experimentation and the use of quantitative methods in psychology were greatly advanced by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795—1878) and Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801 — 78), both professors at the university of Leipzig. In De Tactu (1834) and Der Tastsinn und das Gemeingefuhl (1846), Weber reported the results of a series of experiments on touch, pain, pressure, and temperature, from which emerged “Weber’s law’’ — i.e., that the smallest increment in a stimulus required to produce a difference in the sensation experienced is relative to the magnitude of the stimulus in question. Convinced that the mysteries of the relation between mind and body could be resolved by determining the precise mathematical relations between such stimuli and sensations, the more metaphysically inclined Fechner reduced Weber’s law to quantitative terms. Weber’s law thus became the “Weber-Fechner law,’’ and the “psycho-physical methods’’ which Fechner designed for its verification — all in the interest of anti-materialism — marked the beginning of quantitative experimental psychology (Boring 1950: 293; Ribot 1886: 22, 135).

如上所述(见第120页) ，心理学中的实验和定量方法的使用被恩斯特 · 海因里希 · 韦伯(1795-1878)和费希纳(1801-1878)极大地推进了，他们都是心理学莱比锡大学的教授。在 De Tactu (1834)和 Der Tastsinn und das Gemeingefuhl (1846)中，韦伯报告了一系列关于触摸、疼痛、压力和温度的实验结果，从中得出了“韦伯定律”ーー即，产生不同感觉所需的刺激的最小增量是相对于所讨论的刺激的大小。由于确信精神和身体之间的神秘关系可以通过确定这种刺激和感觉之间的精确数学关系来解决，更形而上学的费希纳将韦伯定律降低为定量术语。韦伯定律因此成为了“韦伯定理”，而费希纳为了验证韦伯定律而设计的“心理-物理方法”ーー这一切都是为了反物质主义ーー标志着定量实验心理学的开始(枯燥的1950:293; 里伯特1886:22,135)。

The other significant figure in German experimental psychology before Wundt was Hermann Ludwig von Helmholtz (1821—94), the physicist and physiologist, student of Muller, and author of both the Handbuch der physiologischen Optik (3 vols., 1856—66) and Die Lehre von dem Tonemp®ndung (1863). If Fechner had “showed that psychology could employ the scientific method of measurement,” Boring observed, these two works:

冯特之前德国实验心理学的另一个重要人物是赫尔曼 · 路德维希 · 冯 · 亥姆霍兹(1821-94) ，他是物理学家和生理学家，穆勒的学生，同时也是《生理学光学手册》(1856-66第3卷)和《托内姆普恩东的教程》(1863)的作者。如果 Fechner“证明了心理学可以使用科学的测量方法,”Boring 观察到，这两项工作:

showed what could be done in research and in the accumulation of facts in the two leading sense-departments [vision and hearing, respectively] . . . With a method of measurement available, with an exhibit of what could actually be done if the experimenter would but get to work, and with the general notion already explicit, it only remained for Wundt to seize the opportunity, to cry the slogan, and psychology as “an independent science’’ would be “founded.” And that, is exactly what Wundt did. (1950: 303)

展示了两个主要感官系统(分别是视觉和听觉)在研究和事实积累方面可以做些什么... ... 有了可用的测量方法，有了一个展示实验者只要开始工作实际上可以做些什么的展示，而且一般概念已经很明确了，只剩下冯特抓住机会，喊出口号，心理学作为“一门独立的科学”将会“建立”这正是冯特所做的。(1950:303)

Wilhelm Wundt was born in the duchy of Baden, in Neckarau, a suburb of Mannheim. At the age of 6, his family moved to the village of Heidensheim where, after two years in the Volkschule, his education was undertaken by the local vicar, Friedrich Muller, a man deeply admired by both Wundt and his parents, and when Muller moved to Munzesheim, Wundt accompanied him and continued his education. At 13, Wundt entered the Gymnasium at Bruschal, moving the following year to the Heidelberg Gymnasium, where he developed the habit of intensive reading that led to his later, encyclopaedic erudition. Boring observed:

威廉 · 冯特出生于 Neckarau 的巴登公国，那里是曼海姆的郊区。6岁时，他的家人搬到了 Heidensheim 村，在人民学校学习了两年后，他的教育由当地的牧师弗里德里希 · 穆勒(Friedrich Muller)承担。穆勒深受冯特和他的父母的钦佩。当穆勒搬到 Munzesheim 时，冯特陪伴着他，继续他的教育。13岁时，冯特进入了 Bruschal 的体育馆，第二年搬到了 Heidelberg Gymnasium，在那里，他养成了精读的习惯，这导致了他后来的百科全书式的博学。无聊的观察:

[A] sober childhood and a serious youth, unrelieved by fun and jollity, which prepared the young Wundt for the endless writing of the ponderous tomes which eventually did so much to give him his place in history. He never learned to play. He had no friends in childhood and only intellectual companions in adolescence. He failed to ®nd parental love and affection, substituting for the more happy relationship this deep attachment for his vicar—mentor. One can see the future man being formed, the humorless, indefatigable, aggressive Wundt.

清醒的童年和严肃的青年，没有被欢乐和快乐所解脱，这使年轻的冯特为无休止地写作沉重的大部头做好了准备，这些大部头最终为他在历史上的地位做出了巨大贡献。他从来没有学过打球。他童年时没有朋友，青春期只有智力上的伙伴。他失去了父母的爱和关怀，取而代之的是更幸福的关系，这种深深的依恋是他的牧师ーー导师。人们可以看到未来的人正在形成，幽默，不知疲倦，好斗的冯特。

In 1851, Wundt attended the university of Tubingen, where he decided to study physiology. Wundt entertained serious doubts as to whether he was suited for the medical profession; but his father had died, his mother's means were limited, and medical training offered him (as it had offered Lotze and Helmholtz before him, and would soon offer Freud) a compromise between becoming a doctor, which would earn him a living, and becoming a scientist, for which his scholarly temperament was more clearly suited. The medical faculties of the German universities “gave a truly academic training,'' Boring explains, but one which might later be rendered prohtable; thus “modern psychology began as physiological psychology” (1950: 317)-

1851年，冯特进入 Tubingen 大学学习生理学。冯特对自己是否适合医学职业抱有严重的怀疑; 但是他的父亲去世了，母亲的财力有限，医学训练给他提供了一个折衷方案(就像在他之前提供给洛兹和亥姆霍兹，并很快提供给弗洛伊德一样) ，一个是为了谋生而成为医生，另一个是为了成为一名科学家，而他的学者气质显然更适合这两种职业。德国大学的医学院“提供了一个真正的学术培训,”无聊解释说，但这个培训后来可能会被提出来，因此“现代心理学从生理心理学开始”(1950:317)-

In 1852, Wundt moved to the university of Heidelberg, where he received a thorough practical training in medicine, simultaneously conducting research and producing his earliest publications. But the intellectual environment of Heidelberg was too practical for Wundt's scientihc disposition, and in the spring of 1856, he went to Berlin to study physiology with Johannes Muller. “[T]he character of German science at Berlin,'' Wundt explained, is “purer in its depth and in its many-sidedness than in the university of southern Germany'' (Boring 1950: 318). Besides Muller in physiology and H. G. Magnus in physics, Wundt learned much from the physiologist and philosopher of science Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818—96), who was then trying to settle a controversy on the nature of muscular contractions. “If anything remained to determine Wundt for the academic life,'' Boring observes, “this stimulating experience at Berlin was decisive'' (Boring 1950: 318).

1852年，冯特来到海德堡大学，在那里接受了全面的医学实践训练，同时进行研究并出版了他最早的出版物。但是海德保的知识环境对冯特的科学天性来说太实际了，1856年春天，他去柏林和约翰内斯 · 穆勒一起学习生理学。冯特解释说: “柏林大学德国科学的特点，在深度和多面性方面都比南德大学更加纯粹。”(无聊1950:318)。除了生理学上的 Muller 和物理学上的 H.G。 Magnus，冯特还从生理学家和科学哲学家 Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-96)那里学到了很多，Emil du Bois-Reymond 当时正试图解决关于肌肉收缩本质的争论。“如果还有什么东西能够决定冯特的学术生涯的话,”无聊观察到，“在柏林的这次刺激性的经历是决定性的”(无聊1950:318)。

In the fall of 1856, Wundt returned to Heidelberg, where he took his doctorate in medicine, and then habilitated as a Dozent (instructor) in physiology from 1857 to 1864. Lecturing in alternate semesters on experimental physiology and medical physics, Wundt simultaneously produced three papers on physiology (1856—57), and his hrst book, Die Lehre von den Muskelbewegungen (1858). More signihcantly, drawing heavily on the works of Muller, Lotze, and Weber, Wundt published the hrst section of his Beitrage zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung (1858), which contained a brief discussion of unconscious inference (unbewusster Schluss) as the mechanism of perception. At about the same time, Wundt became preoccupied with Herbart's Psychologie als Wissenschaft (1824—5), and began to flesh out some of his nascent epistemological notions in a series of introductory lectures on the study of natural science. Like Herbart, Wundt soon concluded that psychology must indeed be a “science”

1856年秋天，冯特回到海德保，在那里他获得了医学博士学位，然后在1857年至1864年成为一名生理学讲师。在实验生理学和医学物理学的交替学期讲课中，冯特同时发表了三篇关于生理学的论文(1856-57) ，以及他的第一本书《肌肉运动的教程》(1858)。更为重要的是，冯特大量引用了穆勒、洛策和韦伯的著作，发表了他的《为了感知理论》(1858)的第一部分，其中包含了对无意识推理(Unbewusster Schluss)作为感知机制的简短讨论。大约在同一时间，冯特开始全神贯注于赫尔巴特的《心理学与科学》(1824-5) ，并开始在一系列关于自然科学研究的介绍性讲座中充实他的一些初生的认识论概念。像赫尔巴特一样，冯特很快得出结论，心理学必须确实是一门“科学”

(Wissenschaft). But unlike Herbart, Wundt also agreed with Fechner that, “as a science” (als Wissenschaft), psychology must be based upon experiment. While all psychology begins with introspection (Selbstbeo-bachtung), Wundt argued, scientific psychology ultimately depends upon two means (Hilfsmittel) by which the scientist proceeds inductively — i.e., experiment and “the natural history of man” (Geschichte, or anthropology). The completed Beitrage of 1862, Boring thus concludes, “has some claim to being the beginning of experimental psychology, partly because it is in content experimental psychology, partly because it presents a formal plea for experimental psychology, called by that name, and partly because, for all its shortcomings, it is Wundt’s first book in experimental psychology” (1950: 320).

(科学)。但与赫尔巴特不同的是，冯特也同意费希纳的观点，即“作为一门科学”，心理学必须以实验为基础。冯特认为，虽然所有的心理学都始于自省(Selbstbeo-bachtung) ，但科学心理学最终依赖于两种手段(Hilfsmittel) ，科学家通过这两种手段归纳出自己的观点，即实验和“人类自然史”(Geschichte，或称人类学)。1862年完成的《贝特雷奇》 ，因此得出无聊的结论，“有一些声称是实验心理学的开端，部分是因为它是实验心理学的内容，部分是因为它提出了实验心理学的正式请求，被称为实验心理学，部分是因为，尽管它的缺点，它是冯特在实验心理学的第一本书”(1950:320)。

In 1862, Wundt began offering a course of lectures on “psychology from the standpoint of natural science,’’ publishing them the following year as Die Vorlesungen uber die Menschen- und Thierseele (1863). The lectures raised a number of issues which would constitute the subject-matter of experimental psychology for years to come, and in 1867, the course-title was changed to “Physiological Psychology,” in preparation for “the most important book in the history of modern psychology” — the Grundzuge der physiologischen Psychologie (1873—4). This was Wundt’s “great argument for an experimental psychology,” one which, in a sense, he would never surpass. Simultaneously the “concrete result of [his] intellectual development at Heidelberg,” the “symbol of his metamorphosis from physiologist to psychologist,” and “the beginning of the new ‘independent’ science,’’ the Grundzuge was “a systematic handbook in both senses of the word; it was built about a system of psychology,” Boring, observes, “and it attempted systematically to cover the range of psychological fact’’ (1950: 322—3).

1862年，冯特开始提供一门关于“从自然科学的角度看心理学”的课程，并于次年以《关于人类和蒂尔西勒的教程》(1863)的名义出版。这些讲座提出了一些问题，这些问题将构成未来几年实验心理学的主题。1867年，课程的名称改为“生理心理学”，为“现代心理学史上最重要的书”ーー《生理心理学基础》(1873ー4)做准备。这就是冯特的“实验心理学的伟大论点”，在某种意义上，他永远不会超越这一论点。同时，“他在海德保智力发展的具体结果”，“他从生理学家到心理学家的转变的象征”，以及“新的‘独立’科学的开始”，《格伦祖格》是“一个系统的手册，在这个词的两个意义上，它是建立在一个心理学系统,”无聊，观察，“它试图系统地涵盖心理学事实的范围”(1950:322ー3)。

An ausserordentlicher Professor (associate professor) since 1864, Wundt had been the presumed successor to Helmholtz’s chair of physiology; but when Helmholtz left for Berlin in 1871, Wundt was passed over for the physiologist Willy Kuhne (1837—1900). In 1874, Wundt thus accepted the chair of inductive philosophy at the university of Zurich and, just one year later, was called to the chair of philosophy at Leipzig. “This change,’’ Boring observes, “is significant. It brought Wundt formally into the ®eld where psychology was supposed to belong, and it brought him there from physiology. Thus began that paradoxical situation . . . whereby experimental laboratories grew up as adjuncts to German chairs of philosophy” (1950: 323). Indeed, granted space in 1875 for the experimental demonstrations related to his lectures, Wundt established, in 1879, the Physio-logische Institut ± the world's ®rst laboratory of experimental psychology: “ a primitive affair of a few rooms, soon increased to eleven,” Boring observes, “it was in this first building that experimental psychology actually got its de jure independence” (1950: 324). Enormously productive, the new laboratory soon required its own medium of publication, and in 1881 Wundt founded the Philosophische Studien, the first effective organ of experimental psychology.

冯特自1864年以来一直是生理学教授(副教授) ，被认为是亥姆霍兹的生理学主席的继任者; 但是当亥姆霍兹于1871年前往柏林时，冯特被生理学家威利 · 库恩(1837-1900)所取代。1874年，冯特接受了苏黎世大学的归纳哲学教授的职位，仅仅一年后，他就被任命为莱比锡大学的哲学教授。“这种变化,”Boring 观察到，“意义重大。它把冯特正式带入了心理学应该属于的领域，并把他从生理学带到了这个领域。于是，这种矛盾的情况开始了... ... 实验室成长为德国哲学教授的附属机构”(1950:323)。事实上，冯特在1875年获得了与他的讲座相关的实验演示的空间，于1879年建立了世界上第一个实验心理学实验室: “一个原始的几个房间的事情，很快增加到11个,”Boring 观察到，“实验心理学实际上在这个第一个建筑中获得了法律上的独立性”(1950:324)。这个新的实验室极富成效，很快就需要有自己的出版媒介，1881年冯特建立了哲学研究所，这是第一个有效的实验心理学机构。

Despite the numerical superiority of the Berlin philosophers, Durkheim could thus observe in 1887, “it is always Leipzig that is preferred by foreigners who come to Germany to complete their philosophical education. It is to Wundt and his teachings that this persistent vogue is due. It is this same cause,” he added, “which led us to Leipzig, and kept us there longer than anywhere else” (1887b: 313—14). The university of Leipzig generally — and the Physiologische Institut in particular — thus became the focus of Durkheim’s “La philosophie dans les universites allemandes’’ (1887), which described the problems under study — e.g., the measurement of reaction time, the estimate of durations, the measurement of sensations of sound, the feeling for musical intervals, the veri®cation of psychological laws by the method of mean graduations, etc. — in considerable and often tedious detail. Durkheim emphasized:

尽管柏林哲学家在数量上占有优势，涂尔干在1887年还是观察到，“来德国完成哲学教育的外国人总是更喜欢莱比锡。对冯特和他的教导来说，这种持久的时尚是应该的。正是这个原因,”他补充道，“使我们来到莱比锡，使我们在那里停留的时间比其他任何地方都长”(1887b: 313ー14)。这些莱比锡大学，尤其是生理学研究所，因此成为迪尔凯姆的《德国大学哲学》(1887)的焦点，该书描述了研究中的问题，例如，反应时间的测量，持续时间的估计，声音感觉的测量，音乐间隔的感觉，通过平均毕业的方法验证心理学规律，等等。涂尔干强调:

We see how each of these topics is precise and restricted, [b]ut however specialized these studies may be, nothing is more capable of raising in young minds the love of scienti®c precision, to divest them of vague generalizations and metaphysical possibilities, and ®nally to make them understand how complex are psychological facts and the laws which govern them — all while showing them that, if this complexity is an obstacle, there is nothing in this to discourage the observer. (1887a: 433)

我们看到这些主题是如何精确和受到限制的，但是无论这些研究是多么专业，没有什么比这更能够提高年轻人对科学精确性的热爱，使他们摆脱模糊的概括和形而上学的可能性，使他们理解心理事实和支配它们的法则有多么复杂ーー同时向他们表明，如果这种复杂性是一个障碍，那么这里没有什么能够阻止观察者。(1887a: 433)

But Durkheim was at least equally emphatic on the limited extent of Wundt’s influence on German scholarship. Whatever autonomy psychology had achieved from philosophy had been won on the early 18th-century ground of Christian Wolff’s distinction between rational and empirical psychology, wherein the latter embraced methods like “personal observation,” “ideological analysis,’’ and an unhealthy dose of metaphysical speculation — but hardly experimentation. Lotze, in Durkheim’s view, was “a metaphysician who has never seen psychology as a positive science,’’ his “quite involuntary” contribution to experimental psychology being “grafted onto a metaphysical hypothesis”; and “it is the metaphysician in Lotze,’’ Durkheim observed, “which Germany honors’’ (1887a: 331). Fechner was “no less a metaphysician than Lotze,’’ Durkheim added, “and it is to his ontological fantasies that he owes the great authority which he enjoys in Germany. As for his psycho-physical researches, which have made his fame here in France, the Germans treat these as relatively worthless’’ (1887a: 331).

但涂尔干至少同样强调冯特对德国学术的有限影响。无论心理学从哲学中取得了什么样的自主性，它都是在18世纪早期基于克里斯蒂安 · 沃尔夫(Christian Wolff)区分理性心理学和经验心理学的基础上取得的，后者采用了“个人观察”、“意识形态分析”和不健康的形而上学推测等方法，但几乎没有实验。在迪尔凯姆看来，洛兹是“一个从未将心理学视为实证科学的形而上学家”，他对实验心理学的“非自愿”贡献被“嫁接到一个形而上学假设上”，而且“这是 Lotze 的形而上学家,”迪尔凯姆评论道，“德国尊重这一点”(1887a: 331)。费希纳“不亚于洛茨，是一个形而上学家,”迪尔凯姆补充说，“正是由于他的本体论幻想，他在德国享有巨大的权威。至于使他在法国声名鹊起的心理-物理研究，德国人认为这些研究相对没有价值”(1887a: 331)。

Wundt, by contrast, “is the first German psychologist who has pretty nearly broken all connections with metaphysics; but his compatriots have found it very difficult to forgive him for this, and his efforts remain rather isolated.’’ There was nothing exceptional about the number of German students in Wundt’s laboratory, Durkheim added, and they failed to give Wundt’s lectures “the interest that they warranted’’ (1887a: 331) — a situation for which Durkheim offered both institutional and intellectual explanations. Institutionally, Durkheim observed, this resistance was the consequence of the organization of philosophical instruction described in “La philoso-phie dans les universites allemandes’’ (see above). “Receiving at the university only a very general education,’’ Durkheim explained, “young philosophers would have some difficulty in then setting about these special studies. They would have to forget a good part of what they had learned, and begin again a new education’’ (1887a: 332). Intellectually, “everyone [in Germany] agrees with Kant,’’ by refusing to reduce the higher for ms of intelligence to experience — a refusal which removes the life of reason from any conceivable psychological scrutiny. This predisposition “makes even the most advanced Germans seem rather timid when they are compared with certain psychologists in France and in England’’ (1887a: 329). Germany, Durkheim insisted, “has nothing which can be compared to the great movement of psychological studies which has its center in the Revue philosophique and in the Societe de psycho-physiologie’’ (1887a: 439). Durkheim even went so far as to argue that Wundt’s fame “is an entirely French [and English] thing. I know some extremely cultivated Germans — academics from Leipzig,’’ Durkheim observed, “who discovered Wundt during the course of traveling in France. It was in Paris that they learned ... of the great position which he occupies in the scientific world’’ (1887a: 331).

相比之下，冯特“是第一个几乎断绝了与形而上学的所有联系的德国心理学家; 但他的同胞们发现很难原谅他的所作所为，他的努力仍然相当孤立。”迪尔凯姆补充说，在冯特的实验室里，德国学生的数量并没有什么特别之处，而且他们没有给冯特的讲座提供“他们应有的兴趣”(1887a: 331)——对于这种情况，迪尔凯姆既提供了制度上的解释，也提供了知识上的解释。涂尔干观察到，在制度上，这种抵制是“德国大学中的哲学-哲学”(见上文)所描述的哲学教学组织的结果。涂尔干解释说: “在大学里只接受非常普通的教育，年轻的哲学家在进行这些特殊的研究时会有一些困难。他们将不得不忘记他们所学到的大部分知识，重新开始新的教育”(1887a: 332)。在智力上，“(德国)每个人都同意康德的观点”，拒绝降低毫秒级智力体验的最高值——这种拒绝将理性的生命从任何可以想象的心理审视中移除。这种倾向“使得即使是最先进的德国人与法国和英国的某些心理学家相比也显得相当胆怯”(1887a: 329)。迪尔凯姆坚持认为，德国“没有任何东西可以与心理学研究的伟大运动相提并论，心理学研究的中心是《讽刺哲学》和《心理生理学会》”(1887a: 439)。涂尔干甚至辩称，冯特的名声“完全是法国(和英国)的东西。“我认识一些非常有教养的德国人ーー来自莱比锡的学者,”涂尔干说，“他们在法国旅行期间发现了冯特。正是在巴黎，他们了解到... 他在科学界所占据的重要地位”(1887a: 331)。

Paradoxically inspired by this unlikely combination of German achievement and French reception, Durkheim called for a “scientific philosophy’’ — i.e., a method which would treat the questions of philosophy according to the procedures of the positive sciences (1887a: 333). In fact, the period during which Durkheim visited Leipzig had become Wundt's philosophische Jahrzehnt, comprising the completion of his Logik (2 vols., 1880-3), his Ethik (3 vols., 1886), and his System der Philosophie (2 vols., 1889). And not surprisingly, the particular philosophical questions to which Durkheim hoped to apply “the procedures of the positive sciences'' were those of ethics. It is to Wundt's great Ethik, therefore, and its impact on Durkheim, that we now turn.

受到德国成就和法国接受的这种不可思议的结合的启发，迪尔凯姆自相矛盾地呼吁一种“科学哲学”ーー也就是说，一种根据实证科学的程序来处理哲学问题的方法(1887a: 333)。事实上，涂尔干访问莱比锡期间已经成为冯特的哲学十年，包括他的逻辑学(2卷，1880-3) ，他的埃塞克(3卷，1886) ，和他的系统的哲学(2卷，1889)完成。毫不奇怪，涂尔干希望应用“实证科学的程序”的特殊哲学问题是伦理学问题。因此，我们现在转向冯特伟大的埃斯克思想，以及它对涂尔干的影响。

WUNDT'S ETHIK (l886)

冯特的伦理学(1886)

“It has been my object in the present work,'' Wundt stated in the first sentence of his preface, “to investigate the problems of ethics in the light of an examination of the facts of the moral life.'' Without denying the earlier contributions of metaphysics, psychology, or even utilitarian ethics, therefore, Wundt declared his own commitment to establishing ethics on an empirical, anthropological foundation. “The straight road to ethics,'' Wundt added, “lies . . . through ethnic psychology, whose especial business it is to consider the history of custom and of ethical ideas from the psychological standpoint” (1897: vi).

冯特在他的序言的第一句中说: “我的目标一直是通过对道德生活事实的审视来研究伦理问题。”因此，冯特并没有否认形而上学、心理学甚至功利主义伦理学的早期贡献，而是宣称他自己致力于在经验主义、人类学的基础上建立伦理学。冯特补充称: “通往伦理学的直道... ... 是通过民族心理学，其特殊职责是从心理学角度考察习俗和伦理思想的历史。”(1897: vi)。

The vocabulary that Wundt brought to this enterprise was German, idealist, and decidedly romantic: “We have forgotten what the romanticists believed about language and myth and history,'' he acknowledged, “their fanciful pictures of ancient civilization, drawn upon so slight a background of fact, have given place to the results of a more sober method. Nevertheless, it is to their efforts,'' he immediately added, “that we owe the impetus to a more sympathetic research into strange worlds and distant periods, such as was hardly felt at all in the century of the Enlightenment. And from this widening of the horizon came that more universal conception of mental life, which, to-day the common property of all the mental sciences, found its full expression for the first time in the philosophical idealism that came after Kant'' (1897—1901: viii). Like his romantic antecedents, Wundt was convinced that the development of morality began with language, and like Durkheim, he was equally convinced that this development occurred according to concrete, objective laws, which could be discovered through inductive generalization (1897—1901: 23, 47).

冯特为这项事业带来的词汇是德语、理想主义和绝对的浪漫主义: “我们已经忘记了浪漫主义者对语言、神话和历史的看法,”他承认，“他们对古代文明的想象画面，基于如此微不足道的事实背景，已经让位于一种更冷静的方法的结果。尽管如此，正是由于他们的努力,”他立即补充道，“我们才有动力对陌生的世界和遥远的时期进行更具同情心的研究，这在启蒙运动的世纪是几乎感觉不到的。”。从这种视野的拓宽中，出现了更为普遍的心理生活概念，今天，这是所有心理科学的共同属性，首次在康德之后的哲学唯心主义中得到了充分的体现。像他的浪漫主义的前辈们一样，冯特坚信道德的发展始于语言，像涂尔干一样，他同样坚信道德的发展是根据具体的、客观的规律发生的，这些规律可以通过归纳推广来发现(1897ー1901:23,47)。

But the witness of language, Wundt warned, despite its “complete objectivity,” provides only the outward symbol of moral development. To understand the conditions underlying the moral development thus revealed, we must examine two other sources of evidence — i.e., religious conceptions, which reveal the inner motives of moral action, and the social norms of custom and law, which manifest its external aims. The further back we go, Wundt explained, the more religious feelings and moral sentiments coincide. Like Durkheim, however, Wundt was a secular moralist; and this argument was thus conjoined with the assertion that religious motives were not essential to the subsequent evolution of moral ideas: “[T]here is nothing in the facts,’’ Wundt insisted, “to prove the impossibility of a complete separation of morality from its ultimate religious connections in some one of the later stages of the moral life . . . [R]eligious motives, while they are indispensable to the origin and initial development of moral ideas, are not indispensable to their continuation, or to the final culmination of their development” (1897—1901: 125—6). But if morality is thus to be “cut off from its original substrate of religious ideas,’’ Wundt added, it must be supported by other motives; and “there is only one group of phenomena which can furnish motives at all comparable with the religious motives in moral power: the customs and usages which have their root in the social conditions of human life’’ (1897—1901: 126).

但是，冯特警告说，语言的见证，尽管它是“完全客观的”，却只是道德发展的外在象征。为了理解道德发展所揭示的条件，我们必须考察另外两个证据来源，即揭示道德行为内在动机的宗教观念，以及表现道德行为外在目的的习俗和法律的社会规范。冯特解释说，我们走得越远，宗教情感和道德情感就越一致。然而，与涂尔干一样，冯特也是一位世俗的道德家; 因此，这一论点与宗教动机对于后来道德观念的演变并非必不可少的断言相结合: “事实上并没有什么,”冯特坚称，“要证明在道德生活的某个后期阶段，道德与其最终的宗教联系完全分离是不可能的... ... 宗教动机虽然对于道德观念的起源和最初的发展是不可或缺的，但对于它们的延续或其发展的最终高潮并非不可或缺”(1897ー1901:125ー6)。但是，冯特补充道，如果道德要“从宗教思想的原始基础上切断”，它必须得到其他动机的支持; 而且“只有一组现象能够提供与道德力量中的宗教动机完全相当的动机: 根植于人类生活的社会条件中的习俗和惯例”(1897ー1901:126)。

What is custom? Briefly, Wundt observed, a custom is a non-obligatory norm of voluntary action, developed in a national or tribal community, which depends for its obedience on neither the subjective command of morality, nor the objective compulsion of law (1897: 131). What is its origin? Even among civilized peoples of the present, Wundt answered, most customs are the survivals of primitive ceremonial acts — particularly those of sacrifice and commensality (1897—1901: 142) — whose original purpose had been forgotten, and which had subsequently been pressed into the service of new ends. Like Durkheim, therefore, Wundt insisted on the analytical distinction between cause and function, and on the religious origin, not only of morality, but of custom as well. Custom was always “at first an act of worship, and so owed its obligatory power partly to the universality of religious ceremonial, and partly to the important place that ritual holds in general estimation by reason of its supposed influence on the favour or disfavour of the gods’’ (1897—1901: 134). And the origin of religious worship itself — i.e., of the act of sacrifice — lies beyond the reach of scholarly observation (1897—1901: 150—1).

什么是习俗？简而言之，冯特观察到，习俗是在民族或部落社区发展起来的自愿行为的非强制性规范，它既不依赖于对道德的主观命令，也不依赖于对法律的客观强制(1897:131)。它的起源是什么？冯特回答说，即使在当代的文明民族中，大多数习俗也是原始仪式行为的遗留物，特别是那些祭祀和共同行为(1897-1901:142) ，它们最初的目的已经被遗忘，随后被迫为新的目的服务。因此，像涂尔干一样，冯特坚持对因果关系和功能的分析性区分，坚持宗教起源，不仅是道德，而且是习俗。习俗总是“起初是一种崇拜的行为，因此它的强制力部分归功于宗教仪式的普遍性，部分归功于仪式所占据的重要地位，因为它被认为对神的偏爱或不偏爱产生了影响”(1897-1901:134)。而宗教崇拜本身的起源ーー也就是牺牲行为的起源ーー超出了学术观察的范围(1897ー1901:150ー1)。

What, then, is the relation of custom to morality, on the one hand, and law, on the other? Like morality, Wundt observed, custom possesses a subjective means of compulsion — i.e., the natural dislike, closely akin to the imitative impulse, of making oneself conspicuously different from one’s fellows; and like law, custom also possesses an objective means of compulsion — i.e., the negative social consequences of any deviation from the normal mode of behavior in any society. This notion of an early period of “non-obligatory constraint” provided the basis for Wundt’s attack on 18th-century theories of legal evolution which postulated a primal period of societal chaos later relieved by the special creation of determinate laws by powerful legislators (the “primitive Lycurgus’’). In the 19th century, Wundt observed, such theories have been largely replaced by those acknowledging that “the looser bond of custom only gradually gave way to the firmer bond of law’’ (1897—1901: 153).

那么，一方面，风俗与道德，另一方面，法律之间的关系是什么呢？冯特观察到，像道德一样，习惯也拥有一种主观的强制手段ーー即，自然的厌恶，类似于模仿的冲动，使自己明显地与同伴不同; 像法律一样，习惯也拥有一种客观的强制手段ーー即，任何社会中偏离正常行为模式的负面社会后果。这种早期“非强制性约束”的概念为冯特对18世纪法律进化理论的攻击提供了基础，这种理论假设了一个社会混乱的原始时期，后来由强有力的立法者(“原始 Lycurgus”)特别创造了确定的法律而得到缓解。冯特观察到，在19世纪，这样的理论在很大程度上已经被那些承认“习惯的松散联系只是逐渐让位于更坚固的法律联系”(1897-1901:153)的理论所取代。

Wundt’s conception of the relation of custom, law, and morality, therefore, was one of an evolutionary differentiation, wherein the latter two, initially almost indistinguishable from custom, gradually became detached, and assumed their respective roles of external and internal obligation. This evolution, Wundt suggested, was the consequence of our increasing need to distinguish between two kinds of customs — i.e., “the one containing all norms of conduct upon whose observance a high value is set — a value so high that in certain circumstances appeal is made for their maintenance to physical force — and the other covering the rules that may safely be entrusted to the gentler form of constraint afforded by the simple desire to do what others do, in order to share with them the approval of the community’’ (1897—1901: 152—3). And like Durkheim, Wundt saw this evolution as “progressive” in nature: “[I]t is the expression of a refinement of ideas,’’ Wundt observed, “which paves the way for the improvement of practical morality’’ (1897—1901: 155—6).

因此，冯特关于风俗、法律和道德关系的概念是一种进化的分化，其中后两者最初几乎与风俗没有什么区别，后来逐渐分离出来，承担起各自的外部和内部义务的角色。冯特认为，这种演变是我们越来越需要区分两种习俗的结果，即“一种是包含所有行为规范的习俗，其遵守规范的价值被设定为很高的价值，这种价值如此之高，以至于在某些情况下，人们呼吁维持它们的物理力量; 另一种是包含规则的习俗，这些规则可以安全地委托给一种较为温和的约束形式，这种约束形式是由简单的愿望所提供的，为了与他们分享共同体的认可”(1897-1901:152-3)。与涂尔干一样，冯特认为这种进化在本质上是“进步的”: “它是思想精炼的表达,”冯特观察到，“为实践道德的改进铺平了道路”(1897ー1901:155ー6)。

In Wundt’s Ethik, this evolutionary treatment of language, religion, custom, law, and morality was offered as an answer to the more psychologistic formulation of Ihering’s Der fweck im Recht (1877—83) — an answer, as we shall see, with which Durkheim agreed. In studying the development of custom, Wundt admitted, we cannot do without psychological interpretation; and such interpretations quite naturally encourage the transformation of the logical connections between ideas like “habit,” “usage,” and “custom” into a chronological succession: “First of all, one might think, the individual habit finds its imitators. Then some utilitarian purpose which it happens to fulfil takes possession of it. And so it gradually takes on an obligatory character, whose stringency varies directly with its extension in space and time” (1897-1901: 159). But, however psychologically plausible such a reconstruction, Wundt argued, this is a question which must always be settled by historical fact; and

在 Wundt 的《伦理思想》中，这种对语言、宗教、习俗、法律和道德的进化论处理，被用来回答伊赫林的《论法律》(1877-83)中更多的心理学表述——我们将看到，迪尔凯姆同意这个答案。冯特承认，在研究习俗的发展过程中，我们离不开心理学的解释; 而这种解释很自然地促进了诸如“习惯”、“使用”和“习惯”等概念之间逻辑联系的顺序转换: “首先，人们可能会认为，个人习惯会找到它的模仿者。然后一些功利主义的目的，它碰巧实现占有它。因此，它逐渐呈现出一种强制性特征，其严格程度直接随着它在空间和时间上的延伸而变化”(1897-1901:159)。但是，无论这种重建在心理学上多么合理，冯特认为，这是一个必须始终通过历史事实来解决的问题;

there is, as a matter of fact, no single national custom of any considerable range or importance — none, i.e., that really deserves the name of custom — where there is factual proof of a development from individual habits . . . The derivation of custom from individual habit is simply a fiction, analogous to the fictions of a first property-holder, or a first law-giver, or a first language-maker, which have been set up to explain the origin of property, of the state, and of language . . . [T]he most important creations of the community - language, myth, custom, law — although influenced by the individual, can never be individually created. (1897—1901: 159—60)

事实上，没有哪个国家的习俗具有相当大的范围或重要性ーー没有哪个国家的习俗真正配得上习俗的名称ーー有事实证据证明，习俗是从个人习惯发展而来的... ... 习俗从个人习惯衍生出来只是一种虚构，类似于第一个财产所有者、第一个法律制定者或第一个语言创造者的虚构，他们被创造出来，是为了解释财产、国家和语言的起源... ... 共同体最重要的创造物ーー语言、神话、习俗和法律ーー尽管受到个人的影响，但永远不可能单独创造出来。(1897ー1901:159ー60)

Wundt’s answer to Ihering’s Der fweck im Recht, was not, it must be emphasized, a categorical denial of the influence of “great individuals” in human history. On the contrary, like Durkheim’s answer to Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology, it was an insistence that “the individual” per se was itself a social fact, the product of a particular, and quite advanced, stage in social evolution (Durkheim 1984: 141—6). “The first condition of personal influence,’’ Wundt thus argued, “is a degree of social freedom that allows individual views to grow and ripen. And freedom,’’ he added, “is wholly and absolutely an achievement of civilisation” (Wundt 1897: 162).

必须强调的是，冯特对伊赫林的《法律上的权利》的回答，并不是对人类历史上“伟大个人”的影响的断然否定。相反，就像迪尔凯姆对赫伯特 · 斯宾塞的社会学原理的回答一样，它坚持认为“个体”本身就是一个社会事实，是社会进化中一个特殊的、相当先进的阶段的产物(迪尔凯姆1984:141ー6)。“个人影响力的第一个条件,”冯特因此认为，“是一定程度的社会自由，允许个人观点的成长和成熟。而自由,”他补充道，“完全而且绝对是文明的成就”(冯特1897:162)。

In order to understand the appeal that Wundt’s Ethik held for Durkheim, we must ®rst examine Durkheim’s conception of the gradual separation of psychology and ethics from traditional philosophy, and the implications of this separation for French higher education. Ancient philosophy, Durkheim felt, had for years been undergoing a “veritable dismemberment” (1887b: 48—9). Psychology, especially in England and France, had already achieved its independence, primarily as the result of its af®nity with the biological sciences generally, and physiology in particular. In Germany, with the notable exception of Wundt, this independence of psychology from philosophy had come more gradually; but the progress of ethics in Germany had been exemplary: “More and more,’’ Durkheim observed, ethics “stops gravitating around metaphysics and vague philosophy, drawn as it is into the sphere of influence of the social sciences. It is through these social sciences that it will emancipate itself” (1887b: 49). This, of course, was the point of Durkheim’s “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne” (1887) — i.e., that the “special social sciences’’ in Germany could play the same role for ethics that physiology had played for psychology in France and England, thus liberating ethics from metaphysics, and allowing French scholars to examine philosophical problems in the spirit of the positive sciences.

为了理解冯特的伦理思想对涂尔干的吸引力，我们必须首先考察涂尔干关于心理学和伦理学逐渐从传统哲学中分离出来的概念，以及这种分离对法国高等教育的影响。涂尔干认为，古代哲学多年来一直在经历一场“名副其实的肢解”(1887b: 48ー9)。心理学，尤其是英国和法国的心理学，已经取得了独立，主要是因为它与生物科学，尤其是生理学有着广泛的渊源。在德国，除了冯特之外，这种心理学从哲学中独立出来的趋势越来越明显，但是德国伦理学的进步堪称典范，迪尔凯姆观察到，伦理学“越来越不再受形而上学和模糊哲学的吸引，因为它已经成为社会科学的势力范围。正是通过这些社会科学，它将解放自己”(1887b: 49)。当然，这就是迪尔凯姆的《德意志道德实证科学》(1887)的观点ーー也就是说，德国的“特殊社会科学”可以在伦理学上扮演与法国和英国的生理学在心理学上扮演的角色相同的角色，从而将伦理学从形而上学中解放出来，并允许法国学者以实证科学的精神审视哲学问题。

How had the Germans, so slow to develop a genuinely scientific psychology, achieved so much more in the field of ethics? For Durkheim, again, the explanation had both an institutional and an intellectual dimension. Institutionally, “the Germans see, in ethics, a social discipline, which must above all be the object of practical instruction, which it is necessary to inculcate in the child from an early age’’ (1887a: 333). This early, social, practical emphasis of the German gymnasium explained both the German distinction (perverse from the French standpoint) between ethics and moral philosophy, and the virtual absence of both from the German universities. Relieved of both practical and philosophical responsibilities, the German professoriate was left to develop a “positive science of ethics’’ at least equally relieved of both utilitarian and metaphysical preoccupations. Intellectually, the French were burdened with an ethical tradition fundamentally mistaken in its premises, its method, and its conceptions of the individual, society, and morality. The premises of this tradition, Durkheim observed, are that “there is a law and a valid morality for all men of all times and all places,’’ and that the prescriptions of ethics can thus have their foundation in “human nature in general’’ (1887a: 336). Its method, whether practiced by rationalist or utilitarian, is deduction: “The only difference that exists between intuitive ethics and the ethics called inductive,’’ Durkheim argued, “is that the first takes for its principle an a priori truth, while the second takes for its principle a fact of experience. But for both, science consists in drawing from these premises, once posed, the consequences that they imply’’ (1887b: 275). And its conceptions of the individual, society, and morality maintain that the first is “an autonomous whole, who belongs entirely to himself by virtue of his absolute liberty,’’ the second is merely “the establishment of relations between all these independent wills,’’ and the third has “no other object but the perfecting of the individual’’ (1887a: 337).

德国人在发展一种真正的科学心理学方面如此缓慢，他们是如何在伦理学领域取得如此大的成就的呢？对涂尔干来说，这种解释同时具有制度性和知识性两个维度。在制度上，“德国人在道德上看到一种社会纪律，它首先必须是实践教育的对象，从小就有必要向孩子灌输”(1887a: 333)。德国体育馆的这种早期的、社会的、实际的强调既解释了德国在伦理学和道德哲学之间的区别(从法国人的观点来看是有悖常理的) ，也解释了德国大学实际上缺乏伦理学和道德哲学。这位德国教授既放下了实践的责任，也放下了哲学的责任，留下来发展一门“实证伦理学”，至少同样放下了功利主义和形而上学的偏见。在理智上，法国人背负着一个从根本上错误的伦理传统，这个传统的前提、方法以及对个人、社会和道德的概念都是错误的。迪尔凯姆观察到，这一传统的前提是“对于所有时代和所有地方的所有人来说，都有一个法律和一个有效的道德”，因此，道德规范可以在“一般的人性”中有其基础(1887a: 336)。它的方法，无论是理性主义者还是功利主义者，都是演绎法: “直觉伦理学和归纳伦理学之间存在的唯一区别,”涂尔干认为，“就是前者认为它的原理是先验的真理，而后者认为它的原理是经验的事实。但是对于两者来说，科学就是从这些前提中提取，一旦提出，它们所暗示的结果”(1887b: 275)。它对个人、社会和道德的概念认为，第一个是“一个自治的整体，凭借他的绝对自由完全属于他自己”，第二个仅仅是“在所有这些独立意志之间建立关系”，第三个“没有其他目标，只有个人的完善”(1887a: 337)。

To these premises, this method, and these conceptions, Durkheim offered unmistakably German objections and alternatives. Against the premises, German scholars had insisted that “this general man, always and everywhere identical to himself, is a pure abstraction, and has never existed in reality. The real, concrete man,’’ Durkheim observed, “changes with the physical and social milieu which surrounds him, and quite naturally, morality changes with men . . . [E]very morality carries . . . the mark of the special context where it was born.’’ Theoretically more accurate, this alternative premise was also of superior practicality: “Morality no longer appears as something abstract, inert, and dead, which is contemplated by impersonal reason. It is a factor of the collective life’’ (1887a: 337). Against the method, Durkheim’s objection was threefold. First, it is simply not true that “morality can be reduced to a single rule and held within a single concept’’; second, even if it were true, this truth could be reached only inductively, not deductively; and third, even if such a truth were reached by inductive means, no particular moral truths could be deduced from it. For “[d]eduction can only apply itself to very simple — i.e., very general — things,’’ Durkheim observed, and “moral phenomena are the most complex in the world. The use of deduction there is thus absolutely misconceived’’ (1887b: 276—7). The significant methodological contribution of the “German School,’’ therefore, was precisely its “protestation against the use of deduction in the moral sciences, and [its] effort to eventually acclimate there a truly inductive method’’ (1887b: 278). And against the traditional, mechanical conceptions of the individual, society, and morality, Durkheim observed, the German school offered a more “organic’’ notion:

对于这些前提、方法和概念，涂尔干明确提出了德国的反对意见和替代方案。在这个前提下，德国学者坚持认为: “这个一般的人，无论何时何地都与他自己完全相同，是一个纯粹的抽象概念，从来不存在于现实中。“真正的、具体的人,”迪尔凯姆评论道，“随着他周围的物质和社会环境的变化而变化，相当自然地，道德也随着人的变化而变化... ... 每一种道德都带有... ... 它诞生的特殊背景的印记。”理论上更为准确的是，这个另类的前提也具有更高的实用性: “道德不再是抽象、惰性和死亡的东西，而是由非个人化的理性来考虑的。它是集体生活的一个因素”(1887a: 337)。对于这种方法，迪尔凯姆有三个反对意见。第一，“道德可以归纳为一个规则，可以归纳为一个概念”，这是不正确的; 第二，即使这是正确的，这个真理也只能归纳，而不是演绎; 第三，即使这个真理是通过归纳的方法得出的，也不能从中推断出任何特定的道德真理。因为“[ d ]教育只能应用于非常简单的ーー也就是非常一般的ーー事物,”迪尔凯姆观察到，“道德现象是世界上最复杂的。”。因此，在那里使用演绎法是完全错误的”(1887b: 276ー7)。因此，“德国学派”在方法论上的重大贡献，正是它“反对在道德科学中使用演绎，并努力最终适应一种真正归纳的方法”(1887b: 278)。与个人、社会和道德的传统机械观念相反，迪尔凯姆注意到，德国学派提供了一个更“有机”的概念:

It has pointed out that this claimed autonomy [of the individual] is only apparent; that there is no abyss between each of us and other men; that heredity reduces us to being only the continuation of our ancestors; that the existence of common feelings erases at every moment the alleged line of demarcations which separates our consciousnesses and confounds them. The individual is an integrated part of the society where he is born. That society penetrates him in every part. To isolate himself and abstract himself from it is to diminish himself. Such a pronounced feeling for the collective life for its reality and its advantages, seems destined to be, up to the present, the essential characteristic of German ethics (1887a: 337—8)

它指出，这种所谓的个人自主权只是表面现象; 我们和其他人之间没有深渊; 遗传使我们仅仅成为我们祖先的延续; 共同感情的存在每时每刻都在抹去所谓的分界线，这条分界线将我们的意识分隔开来，并使它们混淆。个人是他出生的社会中不可分割的一部分。这个社会渗透到他的每一个部分。把自己孤立起来，把自己抽离出来，就是贬低自己。这种对集体生活的现实及其优势的如此明显的感觉，似乎注定到目前为止，是德国伦理学的本质特征(1887a: 337ー8)

It is important to understand that these were not simply Durkheim’s intellectual preferences; rather, they were a part of his continuing support for Jules Ferry’s program of educational reform, and the vocabulary Durkheim used to praise German social science was similar to that he would later use in L’Evolution pedagogique and L’Education morale. Moral education, Durkheim insisted, “can be organized in the lycee only if it is already constituted at the university. A science can comfortably be the object of elementary instruction,” he added, “only if it is already quite advanced’’ (1887a: 440). The education of most French political leaders, Durkheim complained, consists of the interpretation of legal texts, of speculation about the intentions of some legislator of the ancien regime; but these leaders “have no idea of the nature of law, customs, morals, religions, what is the role and the relation of the diverse functions of the social organism, and so on.’’ This is the “national illness of our country. How can we hope to get rid of it,’’ he asked rhetorically, “if we don’t try to reach it at its very roots?’’ “It is urgent,’’ he concluded, “that we import these [German] studies into France, for we indeed have even more need of them than the Germans, since we have undertaken to lead and to govern ourselves’’ (1887a: 440).

重要的是要明白，这些不仅仅是涂尔干的知识偏好; 相反，它们是他继续支持朱尔斯 · 费里的教育改革计划的一部分，涂尔干用来赞美德国社会科学的词汇，类似于他后来在《进化教育学》和《教育士气》中使用的词汇。涂尔干坚持认为，“只有在大学里已经建立了道德教育，才能在中学里组织起来。”。一门科学可以轻松地成为基础教学的对象,”他补充说，“只要它已经相当先进”(1887a: 440)。涂尔干抱怨说，大多数法国政治领导人的教育包括对法律文本的解释，对旧政权某些立法者的意图的推测; 但是这些领导人“不知道法律、习俗、道德、宗教的本质，社会有机体的多种功能的作用和关系是什么，等等。”这就是“我们国家的民族病”。他反问道: “如果我们不努力触及它的根源，我们怎么能够希望摆脱它呢?”他总结道: “我们迫切需要把这些(德国的)研究引进法国，因为我们确实比德国更需要这些研究，因为我们已经承诺要领导和管理自己。”。

For Durkheim, Wundt’s Ethik (1886) was a “synthesis of all these isolated views, of all these special studies with which we have just been concerned’’ (1887b: 136). Moreover, by drawing these “isolated efforts’’ together, the Ethik had simultaneously become their “philosophical expression,’’ and had “given substance to these attempts, which until then had remained rather indecisive and unconscious of themselves and of the goal toward which they tended’’ (1887b: 33). In particular, Durkheim admired Wundt’s methodological insistence on induction rather than deduction, on experience rather than reason: “There is no philosophical science,’’ Durkheim cited Wundt, “where pure speculation is less fruitful than in ethics. For the complexity of the facts there is such that every system constructed by reason alone seems quite worn and impoverished when it is compared with reality . . . In ethics, as elsewhere,’’ Wundt had thus concluded, “we must begin by observing’’ (1887b: 113±14).

对涂尔干来说，冯特的《埃塞克思想》(1886)是“所有这些孤立观点的综合，所有这些我们刚刚关注的特殊研究”(1887b: 136)。此外，通过把这些“孤立的努力”聚集在一起，埃塞克思想同时成为了他们的“哲学表达”，并且“给这些尝试赋予了实质，直到那时，这些尝试仍然是相当优柔寡断和无意识的，他们自己和他们所倾向的目标”(1887b: 33)。涂尔干特别赞赏冯特坚持归纳而不是演绎，坚持经验而不是理性的方法论: “没有哲学科学,”涂尔干引用了冯特的话，“纯粹的推测没有伦理学那么有成效。由于事实的复杂性，与现实相比，单靠理性构建的每个系统似乎都相当破旧和贫乏... ... 在伦理学方面，就像其它领域一样,”冯特因此得出结论，“我们必须从观察开始”(1887b: 113 ± 14)。

In two closely related areas, Durkheim felt that Wundt had gone beyond his German colleagues. As we have already observed, Wundt’s predecessors - particularly the Kathedersozialisten - granted a large role to calculation and will in the evolution of moral ideas. The implication of this concession, Durkheim suggested, is that morality and society are, at least in part, “reflective creations’’ of the human reason. But if reflection had constructed the social world, he added, reflection could “reconstruct” it - i.e., understand it - and thus we would be returned to a rational, deductive method. “To observe, to experiment,” Durkheim thus insisted, “is to resign ourselves to remodeling our ideas on things. But such a method is necessary only if things do not always follow the laws of the understanding” (1887b: 136—7). Despite their “veritable horror for logical abstractions and deep feeling for the complexity of facts,'' therefore, the net effect of the German insistence on calculation and will in the evolution of moral ideas was an unwitting return to reason and dialectic.

在两个密切相关的领域，涂尔干认为冯特已经超越了他的德国同事。正如我们已经观察到的那样，冯特的前任——尤其是 Kathedersozialisten ——赋予了计算和意志在道德观念演变中的重要作用。涂尔干认为，这种让步的含义是，道德和社会至少在某种程度上是人类理性的“反思性创造”。但是，如果反思已经构建了社会世界，他补充说，反思可以“重建”它——也就是说，理解它——因此，我们将回归到一种理性的、演绎的方法。涂尔干因此坚持认为: “观察，实验，就是让我们自己去重塑我们对事物的看法。”。但只有当事物不总是遵循理解的规律时，这种方法才是必要的”(1887b: 136ー7)。尽管他们“对逻辑抽象的真正恐惧和对事实复杂性的深切感受”，因此，德国人坚持计算和意志在道德观念演变中的最终影响是不知不觉地回归理性和辩证法。

For Wundt, Durkheim observed, the question of the nature of morality was rather one, “not of knowing what ought to be according to rigorous logic, but of what is.” Here Durkheim referred directly to Ihering’s explanation of customs as individual habits which, once found useful, had gradually been generalized throughout society. However rational such an explanation might appear, Durkheim said, endorsing Wundt’s response, it is observation, not reason, which must decide; and observation tells us that “a social custom is never derived from a private habit.’’ However strange it might appear, Durkheim thus observed, “customs have always been produced by other customs or, at the origin, by religious practices’’ (1887b: 137). This was an important idea — critical to Durkheim’s later sociological thought — and it is worth noting that Durkheim had at least one more reason for believing it than had Wundt. For Wundt, the insistence on this essentially “irrationalist” posture derived from his belief in what Max Weber has called the “unintended consequences of social action’’ — i.e., the belief that “the motives of our actions are not in rapport with the ends that they produce’’ (1887b: 137). Durkheim concurred, but added a second, largely psychological argument in support — i.e., the belief that we ignore not only the ultimate consequences of our actions, but their true motives as well: “Not only does our action escape from the circle of consciousness by a kind of unforeseen ricochet,’’ Durkheim observed, “but it was never conscious even at the origin. We act without knowing why, or the reasons that we give ourselves are not the true reasons’’ (1887b: 137). Durkheim, in short, had by now embraced the psychology of the unconscious.

涂尔干注意到，对于冯特来说，道德的本质问题是一个“不是根据严格的逻辑知道什么应该是什么，而是知道什么是什么”的问题在这里，迪尔凯姆直接引用了伊赫林对习俗的解释，即个人习惯，这些习惯一旦被发现是有用的，就已经逐渐在整个社会中被推广。无论这种解释看起来多么合理，迪尔凯姆赞同冯特的回答，必须由观察而不是理性来决定; 观察告诉我们，“社会习俗从来不是来自私人习惯。”无论它看起来多么奇怪，涂尔干这样评论道，“习俗总是由其他习俗产生的，或者，在起源上，由宗教实践产生的”(1887b: 137)。这是一个重要的观点ーー对涂尔干后期的社会学思想至关重要ーー值得注意的是，涂尔干至少比冯特多了一个相信这个观点的理由。对冯特来说，坚持这种本质上的“非理性主义”的姿态源于他对马克斯 · 韦伯所说的“社会行动的意外后果”的信仰，即“我们行动的动机与它们产生的目的并不一致”(1887b: 137)。迪尔凯姆同意这一观点，但是补充了第二个主要是心理学上的论点来支持这一观点，即我们不仅忽视了我们行为的最终结果，而且忽视了它们的真正动机: “我们的行为不仅通过一种不可预见的跳弹逃离了意识的圈子,”迪尔凯姆观察到，“而且它甚至在起源时都没有意识。我们不知道为什么而行动，或者我们给自己的理由不是真正的理由”(1887b: 137)。简而言之，涂尔干现在已经接受了无意识的心理学。

A second, closely related issue on which Durkheim preferred Wundt to his predecessors was the question of whether the study of morality could be “scientific.” Recognizing that moral phenomena vary with time and place, Durkheim observed, both the Kathedersozia-listen and the members of the historical school of jurisprudence had a tendency to see morality more as an art than a science: “According to them,” Durkheim summarized, “it belongs to each century to see what is most appropriate to it, and to make that its morality. Above all, it is an affair of practical skill on the part of societies, of their statesmen” (1887b: 137). Wundt, in sharp contrast, argued that “if moral ideas evolve, their evolution occurs according to laws that science can determine, and makes the determination of these laws the first problem of ethics” (1887b: 137-8). It was this “positive science of ethics,” of course, to which De la division du travail social would be Durkheim’s ®rst major contribution.

第二个与之密切相关的问题是，涂尔干比他的前任们更喜欢冯特，那就是道德研究是否可以是“科学的”认识到道德现象随着时间和地点的不同而变化，涂尔干观察到，无论是凯瑟琳倾听者还是法理学历史学派的成员都倾向于把道德看作是一门艺术，而不是一门科学: “根据他们的观点,”涂尔干总结道，“它属于每个世纪，看到什么是最适合它的，并使之成为它的道德。最重要的是，这是社会的一部分，他们的政治家的实际技能事务”(1887b: 137)。与此形成鲜明对比的是，冯特认为，“如果道德观念进化，它们的进化就会根据科学可以确定的规律进行，并且使得这些规律的确定成为伦理学的第一个问题”(1887b: 137-8)。当然，正是这种“积极的伦理学”，迪尔凯姆对社会劳动分工的第一个重要贡献。

But if Wundt’s Ethik had taken German social science two steps forward, Durkheim observed, it had also taken it one step backward. The essential function of morality, Durkheim had already agreed with Wundt’s German predecessors, “was to adapt individuals to one another, and thus to assure the equilibrium and the survival of the group.’’ In fact, Wundt also agreed that morality was “a necessary condition to the existence of societies.’’ The true object of morality, he insisted, “was to make a man feel that he is not a whole, but the part of a whole, and how he is a small thing in view of the unlimited milieux which surround him. As society is found to be one of these milieux, and one of the most immediate,’’ Wundt had argued, “morality has, as its consequence, to make society possible’’ (1887b: 138).

但迪尔凯姆注意到，如果说冯特的埃塞克思想使德国社会科学向前迈了两步，那么它也使德国社会科学向后退了一步。迪尔凯姆已经同意冯特的德国前辈们的观点，道德的基本功能是“使个体彼此适应，从而确保群体的平衡和生存。”事实上，冯特也同意道德是“社会存在的必要条件。”他坚持认为，道德的真正目的“是让一个人感到他不是一个整体，而是一个整体的一部分，在他周围无限的环境中，他是一个多么渺小的东西。由于社会被发现是这些环境中的一个，而且是最直接的环境之一,”冯特争辩道，“因此，道德使社会成为可能”(1887b: 138)。

But for Wundt, Durkheim complained, morality performs this essential function en passant, “accidently and as a consequence,” almost “without wishing it.’’ Morality, Wundt argued, results from the efforts man makes to ®nd an enduring object, one to which he can attach himself, and from which he can taste “a kind of happiness which is not passing.’’ The first objects he encounters in this search are his family, his city, and his country. But these things have their value, Wundt insisted, not because of what they are in themselves, but because of the ideal which they imperfectly symbolize. In short, morality maintains societies (as well as the instincts and inclinations which are its condition) because societies constitute the means whereby the moral sentiment is realized; but societies are never more than transitory phases through which morality passes, “one of the forms that it successively goes through’’ (1887b: 138). This was probably the source of Durkheim’s observation that Wundt’s “imposing mass of facts” was nonetheless “animated by the breath of idealism,” and particularly the idealism of Fichte: “[I]t is ... of Fichte whom we think, since Wundt told us of this undefined and indefinable moral ideal of which exceptional minds alone succeed in achieving consciousness” (1887b: 136).

但涂尔干抱怨说，对冯特来说，道德顺便履行了这一基本功能，“是偶然的，也是结果”，几乎“并不希望它发生”冯特认为，道德源于人类所付出的努力和一个持久的对象，一个他可以依附于自己的对象，一个他可以从中品尝到“一种不会消逝的幸福”的对象在这次搜寻中，他遇到的第一个对象是他的家庭、他的城市和他的国家。但是，冯特坚持认为，这些东西之所以有价值，不是因为它们本身的价值，而是因为它们所象征的理想并不完美。简而言之，道德维系着社会(以及作为其条件的本能和倾向) ，因为社会构成了道德情感得以实现的手段; 但社会永远只是道德通过的短暂阶段，“它相继通过的形式之一”(1887b: 138)。这可能是迪尔凯姆的观察的来源，冯特的“大量的事实”仍然“被唯心主义的气息所激活”，特别是费希特的唯心主义: “[我]它是... 费希特，我们认为，因为冯特告诉我们这种不确定和不确定的道德理想，其中卓越的头脑独自成功地实现意识”(1887b: 136)。

If we accept Wundt’s position, Durkheim warned, one of the essential properties of morality - i.e., its obligatory force - becomes utterly inexplicable. Wundt acknowledged this property “in principle,” Durkheim admitted, but he failed to identify its source, the authority in whose name its commands were uttered. For the religious believer, of course, that name was “God”; but for the agnostic Durkheim, who sought a secular substitute for God, such an explanation was clearly insufficient. For the rationalist, moral commands might be issued in the name of reason, and in recognition of the happiness which follows moral behavior; but reason, Durkheim argued, leads only the mind, not the will, and what is desirable for our own happiness is not thereby obligatory upon us.

迪尔凯姆警告说，如果我们接受冯特的观点，道德的一个基本属性——即它的强制力——就会变得完全无法解释。迪尔凯姆承认，冯特“原则上”承认了这一财产，但他未能确定其来源，也就是以谁的名义发出命令的权威。当然，对于宗教信徒来说，这个名字就是“上帝”; 但是对于不可知论者涂尔干来说，这样的解释显然是不够的。涂尔干寻求一个世俗的上帝的替代品。对于理性主义者来说，道德命令可能是以理性的名义发出的，是对道德行为之后的幸福的承认; 但是迪尔凯姆认为，理性只能引导思想，而不是意志，因此对我们自己的幸福所需要的东西并不强加于我们。

Durkheim did not deny Wundt’s fundamental, idealist premise: “It is a sure fact,’’ he agreed, that “we need to believe that our actions do not exhaust in an instant all their consequences, that they do not hold completely within the point of time and space where they were produced, but rather that they extend their effects more or less far, in duration as in expanse. Otherwise they would be very small things’’ (1887b: 139). But Durkheim did deny that this was the essential factor in moral evolution, arguing, on the contrary, that society was not merely “the means whereby the moral sentiment is realized,’’ but its very source; that society secures less ephemeral pleasures for us precisely because it is not “transitory,” but rather in®nitely outlasts the lifetime of any individual; that morality, in short, was a function of society rather than the reverse (1887b: 140).

涂尔干并没有否认冯特的基本的、唯心主义的前提: “这是一个确定的事实,”他同意，“我们需要相信，我们的行为不会在一瞬间耗尽它们的所有后果，它们不会完全保持在产生它们的时间和空间点上，而是它们或多或少地延伸了它们的影响，在持续时间和广度上。否则它们将是非常小的东西”(1887b: 139)。但迪尔凯姆否认这是道德进化的基本因素，相反，他认为社会不仅仅是“实现道德情感的手段”，而且是它的根源; 社会为我们提供短暂的快乐，恰恰是因为它不是“短暂的”，而是比任何个人的一生都要长久; 简而言之，道德是社会的功能，而不是相反的(1887b: 140)。

DURKHEIM ’ s “ POSITIVE SCIENCE OF ETHICS ’’

DURKHEIM 的“实证伦理学”

In 1882, the Faculty of Letters at the university of Bordeaux established a course in pedagogy, the ®rst of its kind in France, designed to instruct schoolteachers on the practical questions of primary and secondary education. As part of its national drive for a new system of republican, secular instruction, the State began to support the course in 1884, and Espinas, who occupied a chair of philosophy at Bordeaux, assumed the responsibility for teaching it. By 1887, he would be called to the higher administrative rank of Dean of the Faculty of Letters, and a replacement for the course on pedagogy would be needed. Fortunately, Louis Liard, also a former Bordeaux professor, just called to the still higher rank of Minister of Public Education, had someone in mind — an instructor at the Lycee de Troyes who had recently visited Berlin, Marburg, and Leipzig, returning to publish two provocative essays on German education and social science.

1882年，波尔多大学的文学院开设了一门教育学课程，这是法国第一门此类课程，旨在就中小学教育的实际问题向学校教师提供指导。1884年，国家开始支持这门课程，作为推动建立一种新的共和世俗教育体系的全国性努力的一部分，埃斯皮纳斯在波尔多担任哲学系主任，承担起了教授这门课程的责任。到1887年，他将被任命为文学院院长，担任更高的行政职务，因此需要更换教育学课程。幸运的是，刚刚被任命为公共教育部长的前波尔多教授路易斯•利亚德(Louis Liard)心中已有人选ーー特洛伊中学(Lycee de Troyes)的一名教师最近访问了柏林、马堡和莱比锡，回来发表了两篇关于德国教育和社会科学的具有煽动性的文章。

Durkheim was thus appointed charge de cours of social science and pedagogy in the Faculty of Letters at the university of Bordeaux. Durkheim’s first lecture-course on social science (1887—8), given each Saturday morning, was titled “La Solidarite sociale,’’ and its opening lecture described “the succession of transformations through which sociology has passed since the beginning of this century’’ (1978a: 44). After noting the achievements and limitations of the classical political economists, Comte, Spencer, and Espinas, Durkheim went on to praise the works of Schaeffle, Wagner, Schmoller, Ihering, and Post. “We have seen [sociology’s] birth with the [classical political] economists,” Durkheim summarized, “its founding with Comte, its consolidation with Spencer, its orientation with Schaeffle, and its specialization with the German jurists and economists” (1978a: 61—2).

迪尔凯姆因此被任命为波尔多大学文学院社会科学和教育学课程的负责人。涂尔干的第一堂社会科学讲座课程(1887ー8) ，每周六上午举行，题为“社会团结”，其开幕讲座描述了“社会学自本世纪初以来经历的一系列转变”(1978a: 44)。在注意到古典政治经济学家 Comte、斯宾塞和 Espinas 的成就和局限性之后，迪尔凯姆接着赞扬了 Schaeffle、瓦格纳、施莫勒、伊赫林和波斯特的著作。涂尔干总结道: “我们已经看到(社会学)与(古典政治)经济学家一起诞生，它与孔德一起创立，与斯宾塞一起巩固，与谢弗尔一起定位，与德国法学家和经济学家一起专门研究”(1978a: 61ー2)。

On the Saturdays that followed, Durkheim’s lectures set out the argument which would become De la division du travail social (1893).[65](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark77) The “initial problem of sociology,’’ he emphasized, is social solidarity; indeed, before the lecture-course could venture further, “we [have] to know what bonds unite men to one another or, in other words, what determines the formation of social aggregates” (1978d: 205). Focusing in particular on functional questions, therefore, Durkheim argued that the role of creating and maintaining social solidarity, once performed by “common ideas and sentiments,” was now performed by an increasingly specialized division of labor, a fundamental, evolutionary change in the nature of morality itself. Modern economic relationships, Durkheim agreed with the German political economists, thus had unmistakable moral consequences, and these were best studied through the detailed, inductive observation of legal sanctions.

在接下来的周六，迪尔凯姆的讲座阐述了这个论点，这个论点后来成为社会劳动分工(1893)。“社会学的最初问题,”他强调，是社会团结; 实际上，在讲座课程可以进一步探讨之前，“我们(必须)知道什么样的纽带将人们联系在一起，或者换句话说，什么决定了社会总量的形成”(1978d: 205)。因此，涂尔干特别关注功能性问题，他认为，创造和维护社会团结的作用，一度由“共同的思想和情感”来完成，现在由日益专业化的劳动分工来完成，这是道德本身性质的一个根本性的进化性变化。涂尔干赞同德国政治经济学家的观点，认为现代经济关系具有明确的道德后果，而这些道德后果最好通过法律制裁的详细归纳观察来研究。

At the outset of his second lecture-course, “La Famille: origines, types principaux’’ (1888-9), Durkheim could thus tell his audience that “another opening lecture’’ was unnecessary, for “sociology is no longer a foreign discipline to which you must be introduced” (1978d: 205). Instead, this second, “more specialized” course would deal with “one specific type’’ of sociability: “ . . . the simplest group of all, the one whose history is most ancient’’ - i.e., the family (1978d: 207). But the method which Durkheim would employ in this second course was no less German in inspiration than the first. How do we discover the causes which account for the forms and relations of the modern European family? In the natural sciences, Durkheim observed, causes are discovered through experimentation; but experiments “in the strict sense’’ (i.e., the artificial reproduction of the events of nature), he admitted, are not possible in the social sciences. As he had in the Sens lectures, however, Durkheim appealed to Bernard’s Introduction a I'etude de la medicine experimentale (1865), insisting that the “essence” of experimentation is not the production of artificial phenomena, but rather the comparison of phenomena under variable conditions, enabling the scientist to distinguish “accidental” conditions from their “essential” counterparts, and to identify the latter as the causes (or effects) of the phenomena in question.

在他的第二堂课的开始，“家庭: 起源，类型主要”(1888-9) ，涂尔干因此可以告诉他的听众，“另一个开场演讲”是不必要的，因为“社会学不再是一个外国学科，你必须介绍”(1978d: 205)。相反，这第二门“更专业”的课程将涉及“一种特定类型”的社交能力: “ ... ... 最简单的群体，历史最古老的群体”——即家庭(1978d: 207)。但迪尔凯姆在第二道菜中采用的方法，在灵感上不亚于第一道菜中的德国方法。我们如何发现造成现代欧洲家庭形式和关系的原因？涂尔干观察到，在自然科学中，原因是通过实验发现的，但他承认，“严格意义上”的实验(即自然事件的人工生殖)在社会科学中是不可能的。然而，正如迪尔凯姆在森斯的讲座中所做的那样，他诉诸于伯纳德的《实验医学研究导论》(1865年) ，坚持认为实验的“本质”不是人为现象的产生，而是在可变条件下对现象的比较，使科学家能够区分“偶然”条件和“本质”条件，并确定后者是有关现象的原因(或结果)。

Still, Durkheim acknowledged that experimentation in the social sciences is different from that in their natural scienti®c counterparts. In the latter, experimentation is “direct” (i.e., the scientist artificially produces the variable conditions in the laboratory) while in the social sciences, it remains “indirect” (i.e., the variable conditions must be discovered in “nature” itself). And even indirect experimentation, Durkheim admitted, presupposes a fund of empirical knowledge (e.g., of the various types of the family, of their constituent elements, of the types of their interrelationships, of their origin, etc.) which simply did not exist. “Although great efforts to advance this problem have been made since the middle of the century,’’ Durkheim observed, “the results obtained, while very important in other respects, are still incomplete and in some cases in dispute. We can, therefore, neither limit ourselves to those which are de®nitely established, nor accept without prior examination those which are still under discussion” (1978d: 210).

尽管如此，涂尔干承认社会科学中的实验与自然科学中的实验是不同的。在后者中，实验是“直接的”(即，科学家在实验室中人为地产生可变条件) ，而在社会科学中，实验仍然是“间接的”(即，可变条件必须在“自然”本身中发现)。涂尔干承认，即使是间接的实验，也预先假设了一些根本不存在的经验知识(例如，各种类型的家庭，它们的构成要素，它们相互关系的类型，它们的起源等等)。涂尔干说: “尽管自本世纪中叶以来，人们为推进这一问题作出了巨大努力，但所取得的成果尽管在其他方面非常重要，但仍然不完整，在某些情况下还存在争议。因此，我们既不能将自己局限于那些已经确定的事物，也不能未经事先审查就接受那些仍在讨论中的事物”(1978d: 210)。

Under these circumstances, Durkheim observed, the only method is to proceed historically and inductively, concentrating on customs, mores, and laws - “the residue of the collective experiences of a whole series of generations” — and gathering as large a body of facts as possible (1978d: 214). Where are such facts to be found? Durkheim admitted that few of the works in which these documents are found are written in French, although he mentioned Fustel in a passing reference to studies of the Roman family, and specihcally cited Giraud Teulon’s Les Origines du mariage et de la famille (1884) and Charles Letourneau’s recent L’Evolution du mariage et de la famille (1888). Of studies in English, Durkheim referred to Henry Sumner Maine’s Ancient Law (1862), W E. Hearn’s The Aryan Family (1879), and the third part of Herbert Spencer’s Principles of Sociology (1876) — “devoted in its entirety to this subject, but from which there is little to retain’’ — and the increasingly significant work of the British and American ethnographers. But by far the most significant body of works, were by German authors.

迪尔凯姆观察到，在这种情况下，唯一的方法是历史性地、归纳性地进行，集中于习俗、风俗和法律——“一系列整体经验的残余”——并尽可能收集大量的事实(1978d: 214)。在哪里可以找到这样的事实？涂尔干承认，这些文献中很少有用法语写成的，尽管他在提及罗马家庭研究时提到了福斯特尔，并特别引用了吉罗 · 特隆(Giraud Teulon)的《婚姻与家庭的起源》(Les Origines du marage et de la famille，1884)和查尔斯 · 莱托尔诺(Charles Letourneau)最近的《婚姻与家庭的进化》(L’Evolution du marage et de la famille，1888)。关于英语研究，迪尔凯姆提到了亨利·萨姆奈·梅因的《古代法律》(1862年)、赫恩的《雅利安家族》(1879年)以及赫伯特 · 斯宾塞的《社会学原理》(1876年)的第三部分ーー“完全致力于这一主题，但几乎没有什么可保留的”ーー以及英国和美国人种学家日益重要的工作。但到目前为止，最重要的作品，是德国作家的作品。

De la division du travail social was itself the product of Durkheim’s lengthy immersion in these Ger man sources. The work begins with a critique of classical political economy — i.e., of Adam Smith’s exclusively economic conception of the consequences of an increasingly specialized division of labor — and proceeds to argue that the division of labor is also a law of nature and a moral rule, the “categorical imperative” of the modern European conscience (1984: 1—3). Even more than Maine’s Ancient Law (1862), it insists that law, far from being “an artihcial creation of the legislator,” rather “expresses customs, and if it acts against them, it [acts] with a force that it has borrowed from them’’ (1984: 98—9). To understand the evolution of law, therefore, we must reconstruct the customs of antiquity by historical, inductive means, in the manner of Theodor Waitz’s Anthropologie der Naturvolker. And in support of his deeply held and repeatedly expressed conviction that the human capacity for happiness is extremely limited, and that the desire for happiness must thus be causally insignificant, Durkheim cited the law of Weber and Fechner, and the modi®cations it had undergone in Wundt’s laboratory, which showed that pleasure is always the mean between two extremes (1984: 180—2).

社会劳动分工本身就是迪尔凯姆长期沉浸在这些德国人资源中的产物。这本书以对古典政治经济学的批判开始ーー也就是亚当 · 斯密关于日益专业化的劳动分工的后果的唯一经济学概念ーー然后进一步论证劳动分工也是一种自然法则和道德规则，是现代欧洲良知的“定言令式”(1984:1ー3)。它甚至比缅因州的古代法律(1862)更坚持认为，法律，远非“立法者的人为创造”，而是“表达习俗，如果它的行为与他们相反，它[行为]借鉴了他们的力量”(1984:98ー9)。因此，要理解法律的演变，我们必须以西奥多 · 韦茨的《自然人类学》的方式，通过历史的、归纳的手段来重建古代的习俗。迪尔凯姆深信，人类获得幸福的能力是极其有限的，因此对幸福的渴望必然是因果关系上微不足道的。为了支持这一信念，迪尔凯姆引用了韦伯和费希纳定律，以及它在 Wundt 实验室里经历的修改，这些修改表明，快乐总是介于两个极端之间的平均值(1984:180ー2)。

Perhaps the clearest evidence of the German provenance of the arguments of De la division du travail social, however, is the suppressed and frequently ignored preface to the first, 1893 edition.[66](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark78) How, Durkheim asked, do we know that a particular rule is “moral”? The traditional answer, he observed, is to confront the rule with some preestablished, a priori formula, and to give the rule a moral value to the extent that rule and formula coincide. But to grant this answer any authority, Durkheim argued, the formula itself must be “an incontestable scientific truth’’; and not only are there as many formulae as there are moralists, their diversity belying any “so-called objective value,’’ but the formulae themselves are palpably inadequate.

然而，德国社会劳动分工论证的最明显的证据，或许是1893年第一版的序言被压制和经常被忽视。涂尔干问道，我们怎么知道一个特定的规则是“道德的”？他观察到，传统的答案是用一些预设的、先验的公式来对抗规则，并在规则和公式一致的情况下赋予规则以道德价值。但是迪尔凯姆认为，要赋予这个答案任何权威，公式本身必须是“无可争议的科学真理”; 不仅公式的数量和道德家一样多，它们的多样性掩盖了任何“所谓的客观价值”，而且公式本身明显不够充分。

Here Durkheim rehearsed his attack on both rationalist and empiricist ethics, arguing again that, albeit in different ways, both make the same mistake. “The procedure of one, as well as the other,’’ he insisted, “is the following: they start from the concept of man, deducing the ideal from what seems to them suitable to a being who is thus de®ned; and having set up this ideal, they derive from it the supreme rule of conduct, the moral law’’ (1933: 421). Why does this method fail? First, Durkheim observed, it fails because the concept of “man” upon which it depends has no empirical basis (1933: 421-2). Second, even if this concept were “perfectly exact,’’ the deductive inferences derived from it would remain merely conjectural; for deduction, Durkheim repeated, “does not constitute sufficient proof’’ (1933: 422). But most important, Durkheim argued, these “logical operations’’ utterly misconceive the function of ethics itself - i.e., they assume that the raison d’etre of all ethical rules is to ensure the development and perfectibility of the individual man, when it is at least equally plausible that such rules serve social ends, to which the individual remains subservient. In the Sens lectures, of course, Durkheim had also assumed that the role of ethics is to ensure the perfectibility of the individual person; but by 1893, that goal had been replaced by the ends of society.

在这里，涂尔干演练了他对理性主义和经验主义伦理学的攻击，再次提出，尽管方式不同，但两者都犯了同样的错误。他坚持认为: “一个和另一个的过程是这样的: 他们从人的概念出发，从他们认为适合于这样一个存在的东西中推断出理想; 建立了这个理想之后，他们从中衍生出行为的最高准则，道德法则”(1933:421)。为什么这个方法会失败？首先，涂尔干观察到，它失败是因为它所依赖的“人”概念没有经验基础(1933:421-2)。其次，即使这个概念是“完全精确的”，从中得出的演绎推论仍然只是推测; 对于演绎，迪尔凯姆重申，“不构成足够的证据”(1933:422)。但最重要的是，涂尔干认为，这些“逻辑运作”完全误解了伦理本身的功能——也就是说，他们认为所有伦理规则的存在理由是为了确保个人的发展和完善，而这些规则服务于社会目的，即个人仍然服从社会目的，至少是同样合理的。当然，在 Sens 的讲座中，迪尔凯姆也假定伦理学的作用是确保个人的完美性; 但是到了1893年，这个目标已经被社会的终结所取代。

What are these ends? That question, Durkheim repeated, can be answered only “through the observation of moral facts; which is to say, that multitude of particular rules effectively governing conduct. It would have to be begun by establishing a science, which, after having classed the moral phenomena, would look for the conditions upon which each of these types depends, and would determine its role. This means a positive science of ethics.’’[67](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark79) In one sense, this is what Wundt had attempted in the first volume (“The Facts of the Moral Life”) of his Ethik (1886). But Durkheim, as we have already seen, viewed Wundt as a Fichtean idealist, and found confirmation of this view in the second volume (“Ethical Systems”), a survey of the different systems of ethics as they have succeeded one another from antiquity to the present day.[68](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark80) Such a survey has value, Durkheim argued, only on the assumption that moral rules are “eternal verities receiving their value from themselves or from a transcendental source,” that these truths are gradually revealed to man throughout history, and that their social and historical context has but the “secondary influence” of bringing such truths periodically to light, facilitating but not determining their progress (1933: 422—3).

这些是什么？涂尔干反复强调，这个问题只能“通过观察道德事实来回答，也就是说，众多特定的规则有效地支配着行为。”。它必须从建立一门科学开始，这门科学在对道德现象进行分类之后，将寻找每一种道德现象所依赖的条件，并确定其作用。这意味着一门积极的伦理学。”67从某种意义上说，这正是冯特在他的《埃塞克思想》(1886)的第一卷(《道德生活的事实》)中所尝试的。但是，正如我们已经看到的，涂尔干将冯特视为费希特的理想主义者，并在第二卷(《伦理体系》)中发现了对这一观点的证实，这是一个对不同伦理体系的调查，因为它们从古至今彼此继承。涂尔干认为，这样的调查有价值，只是基于这样一个假设，即道德规则是“从自身或超验来源接受其价值的永恒真理”，这些真理在整个历史中逐渐向人类揭示，它们的社会和历史背景只有“次要影响”，即周期性地揭示这些真理，促进但不决定它们的进步(1933:422ー3)。

By 1893, Durkheim was far too much of an historical and ethical relativist to entertain such an argument. History, he argued, “has shown that what was moral for one people was immoral for another, not only in fact, but in law.” Indeed, had the tribe or the city-state respected individual freedom as we do, Durkheim observed, those societies could not have survived; for if such societies were to maintain themselves, “it was absolutely necessary for the individual to be less covetous of his independence.” Wundt’s idealism, in short, would lead us to judge as “moral” some activities which would literally subvert the societies in which they were practiced. “[M]oral rules,’’ Durkheim concluded, “are moral only in relation to certain experimental conditions; and, consequently, the nature of moral phenomena cannot be understood if the conditions on which they are dependent are not determined” (1933: 423-4).

到1893年，涂尔干是一个太多的历史和伦理相对主义者考虑这样一个论点。他认为，历史“已经表明，一个民族的道德对另一个民族来说是不道德的，不仅在事实上，而且在法律上也是如此。”事实上，迪尔凯姆观察到，如果部落或城邦像我们一样尊重个人自由，那些社会就不可能生存下来; 因为如果这样的社会要维持自身，“个人就绝对有必要减少对自身独立性的觊觎。”简而言之，冯特的理想主义将引导我们判断某些活动是否“道德”，这些活动实际上会颠覆实践这些活动的社会。迪尔凯姆总结道: “口头规则只有在特定的实验条件下才具有道德性; 因此，如果它们所依赖的条件不被确定，道德现象的本质就无法被理解”(1933:423-4)。

In sum, the failure of the French system of scienti®c education had roots that reached back to the Revolution and the First Empire. Well before the humiliation of the Franco-Prussian War, therefore, the recognition of this failure had led to the system of awarding scholarships to the brightest French agreges, and thus to Durkheim’s visit to Germany in 1885—6. Encouraged to pay special attention to the state of the social sciences in Germany, and already intimately familiar with the works of Espinas and Schaeffle, Durkheim was especially attracted to developments in political economy, jurisprudence, ethnography and (to a lesser extent) sociology that — taken together - suggested ways of thinking and speaking of social phenomena as “will-independent,” and as the consequence of impersonal social and historical causes. This “positive science of ethics” was epitomized in the work of Wilhelm Wundt, whose Leipzig laboratory Durkheim visited and praised for its study of psychological phenomena in all their concrete complexity, and whose Ethik — indebted to the German Romantics — liberated ethics from metaphysics, and connected it empirically to custom and law.

总之，法国科学教育体系的失败可以追溯到大革命和第一帝国时期。因此，早在普法战争蒙羞之前，对这一失败的承认就已经导致了向法国最聪明的学者颁发奖学金的制度，从而导致了涂尔干在1885-1886年的德国之行。迪尔凯姆被鼓励特别关注德国社会科学的现状，并且已经非常熟悉 Espinas 和 Schaeffle 的著作，他尤其被政治经济学、法理学、人种学和(在较小程度上)社会学的发展所吸引，这些发展综合起来提出了“意志独立”的思维方式和社会现象的说法，并且是非个人的社会和历史原因的结果。这种“伦理学的实证科学”在冯特的著作中得到了概括，他的莱比锡实验室迪尔凯姆参观并赞扬了他对所有具体复杂性的心理现象的研究，他的埃斯特思想借助于德国浪漫主义将伦理学从形而上学中解放出来，并将其与习俗和法律联系起来。

Returning from Germany, Durkheim began to work out the arguments that became De la division du travail social (1893), whose dependence on these German sources is palpable on every page. But Wundt’s Fichtean idealism had left Durkheim with no explanation for the distinctive, obligatory force behind moral commands. In the preface to the 1893 edition, for example, “moral facts’’ are defined as rules of conduct bearing necessary, predetermined, societal sanctions; but this, Durkheim admitted, is merely a “more precise and scientific” articulation of their obligatory force — a better definition perhaps, but not yet an explanation (1933: 424—5). By the second, 1902 edition, however, Durkheim was able to present a relatively complete theory of the “religio-moral” authority of the ancient and medieval occupational groups, emphasizing the origin of their authority in the celebrations, banquets, and sacrifices of ancient religious cults (1984: esp. xxxix—xliv). Several significant events had intervened, including Durkheim’s lecture-course on religion in 1894—5, during which he apparently became acquainted with the works of “Robertson Smith and his school,’’ and still later, his disagreements with James Frazer over the interpretation of Australian totemism. Among the most important of these events, however, was Durkheim’s confrontation with his most formidable opponent, Gabriel Tarde, which — together with the Dreyfus Affair — led him to re-read and re-assess the resources available to him in Rousseau’s Le Contrat social and Emile.

从德国回来后，涂尔干开始研究后来成为社会劳动分工(1893)的论点，这些论点对德国资源的依赖在每一页上都是显而易见的。但是冯特的费希特唯心主义使涂尔干无法解释道德命令背后独特的、强制性的力量。例如，在1893年版本的序言中，“道德事实”被定义为具有必要的、预先确定的、社会制裁的行为规则; 但涂尔干承认，这仅仅是“更精确和科学的”对其强制力量的阐述ーー也许是一个更好的定义，但还不是一个解释(1933:424ー5)。然而，在1902年的第二版中，涂尔干能够提出一个相对完整的关于古代和中世纪职业群体的“宗教-道德”权威的理论，强调他们的权威起源于古代宗教仪式的庆祝、宴会和祭祀(1984:。Xxxix ー xliv)。几个重大事件发生了变化，包括涂尔干在1894-1895年的宗教讲座，在那期间他显然熟悉了“罗伯逊 · 史密斯和他的学校”的作品，以及后来他与詹姆斯 · 弗雷泽在澳大利亚图腾崇拜的解释上的分歧。然而，在这些事件中，最重要的是迪尔凯姆与他最强大的对手加布里埃尔•塔德(Gabriel Tarde)的对峙，再加上《德雷福斯事件》(Dreyfus Affair) ，让他重新阅读和评估了卢梭的《社会契约论》(Le Contracat social)和《埃米尔》(Emile)中提供给他的资源。

CHAPTER 5

第五章
 
## The yoke of necessity 必然的枷锁
 
At this point, my argument — that Durkheim was cobbling together a social realist vocabulary to replace the problematic legacy of Cartesian rationalism — seems to face an obstacle. For while De la division du travail social follows logically from his German visit, Durkheim also wrote a Latin thesis, Quid Secundatus Politicae Scientiae Instituendae Contulerit (1892), on Montesquieu’s De l'esprit des lois (1748). Why, one might ask, would Durkheim make Montesquieu — the “greatest exponent of the Cartesian interpretation of history’’ (Thompson 1942: 61—2; Peyre 1960: xiii) — the focus of this thesis? If Durkheim’s goal was to replace the language of Cartesian rationalism, including its emphasis on clear and distinct ideas deduced from first principles, with this quite different vocabulary emphasizing induction carried out through the careful observation and collection of concrete things, why would he have been so preoccupied with the place of Montesquieu in the development of modern social science? If Durkheim’s attachment for the Enlightenment was as ambivalent as L'Evolution pedagogique and L'Education morale suggest, and his early sources as German and romantic as his 1887 essays indicate, why would the Latin thesis begin with the assertion that it was Montesquieu who had “laid down the principles of the new discipline’’?[69](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark81)

在这一点上，我的观点ーー即涂尔干正在拼凑一套社会现实主义词汇，以取代笛卡尔理性主义留下的问题ーー似乎面临着一个障碍。因为虽然社会工作的分工顺理成章地遵循了他的德国之行，但迪尔凯姆还写了一篇拉丁文论文《 Quid Secundatus Politicae Scientiae constitendae conulerit 》(1892) ，论述了孟德斯鸠的论法的精神(1748)。有人可能会问，为什么迪尔凯姆要把孟德斯鸠ーー“笛卡尔历史解释的最伟大倡导者”(汤普森1942:61ー2; 佩尔1960: xiii)ーー作为本文的重点？如果迪尔凯姆的目标是取代笛卡尔理性主义的语言，包括强调从第一原则推导出的清晰而独特的思想，用这种强调通过仔细观察和收集具体事物进行归纳的完全不同的词汇，为什么他会如此专注于孟德斯鸠在现代社会科学发展中的地位？如果迪尔凯姆对启蒙运动的执着如同《进化教育学》和《教育士气》所暗示的那样矛盾，如同他1887年的文章所表明的那样，他的早期资料来源是德国的和浪漫的，那么为什么拉丁文论文的开头要断言是孟德斯鸠“制定了新学科的原则”呢？69

AMBIVALENT CARTESIANS

双向笛卡尔

To answer these questions, one must first appreciate the extremely ambiguous position Montesquieu occupied within the context of the French Enlightenment, as well as the ambivalent nature of his own commitment to Cartesian rationalism. For it was precisely this ambiguity and ambivalence that made Montesquieu the perfect subject for the Latin thesis, and the latter an ideal vehicle for Durkheim’s own attempt to come to terms with his problematic Cartesian legacy.

要回答这些问题，人们必须首先理解孟德斯鸠在法国启蒙运动中所处的极其模糊的立场，以及他自己对笛卡尔理性主义的承诺的矛盾性质。正是这种模棱两可和矛盾心理，使孟德斯鸠成为拉丁文命题的完美主题，而拉丁文命题正是迪尔凯姆自己试图接受笛卡尔遗产的理想载体。

To understand Montesquieu’s thought, Isaiah Berlin once argued, we must first have some grasp of the way French rationalists viewed the world at the time Montesquieu wrote De l'esprit des lois (1748). As a consequence of the scientific, philosophical, and mathematical innovations that took place between the publication of Copernicus’ De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (1543) and Newton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), the world of nature was conceived as one governed by clear-cut laws and principles, in terms of which the movement of each particle in space appeared explicable through logical, deductive inference, while the world of culture and society

为了理解孟德斯鸠的思想，以赛亚 · 柏林曾经主张，我们必须首先理解法国理性主义者在孟德斯鸠写论法的精神时(1748年)看待世界的方式。从哥白尼的天体运行论(1543年)到牛顿的自然哲学的数学原理(1687年) ，科学、哲学和数学创新发生了很多变化。作为这些变化的结果，自然界被认为是一个由清晰的定律和原则支配的世界，根据这些定律和原则，每个粒子在空间中的运动似乎可以通过逻辑、演绎推理得到解释，而文化和社会的世界

seemed uncharted and unchartable. The human science presented itself as a field for the play of blind chance and irrational forces, good and bad fortune, the whims of despots, adventurers, and popular passions, which left the way open to metaphysical and theological explanations unsupported by anything worthy of the name of evidence, conducted by methods the opposite of rational, the happy hunting-ground of bigots and charlatans and their dupes and slaves. (1980b: 133)

似乎没有地图，也没有地图。人类科学把自己描绘成一个盲目的机会和非理性力量、好运和坏运气、独裁者、冒险家和大众激情的游戏场所，这为形而上学和神学的解释开辟了道路，这些解释没有任何值得证据支持的东西，通过与理性相反的方法进行，是偏执狂和骗子以及他们的受骗者和奴隶的快乐狩猎场。(1980b: 133)

This view of two distinct realms — one governed by regular laws and the other left to chaos and caprice — was widely shared by rationalists and anticlericals of the 17th century. Descartes himself simply dismissed history and the “human sciences’’ generally as being of no interest to genuine seekers after truth, for they were incapable of yielding either precise definitions or the clear rules of evidence from which irrefutable conclusions could be drawn by logical deduction. “[P]roud and magnificent palaces built only on sand and mud,’’ Descartes characterized moral philosophy, and “in so far as they borrow their principles from philosophy,’’ he added of other sciences, “I decided that nothing solid could have been built upon such shaky foundations” (1985: 113—15).

17世纪的理性主义者和反教权主义者普遍认同这种关于两个截然不同的领域的观点: 一个受正规法律管辖，另一个任由混乱和反复无常。笛卡尔本人对历史和“人文科学”不屑一顾，认为它们对真正的真理追求者毫无兴趣，因为它们既不能提供精确的定义，也不能提供明确的证据规则，从而可以通过逻辑推理得出无可辩驳的结论。笛卡尔将道德哲学描述为“仅仅建立在沙子和泥土上的圆形宏伟的宫殿”，他还补充道，“至于他们从哲学中借鉴的原则”，“我认为没有任何坚固的东西可以建立在如此不稳固的基础上”(1985:113-15)。

It is in this context that we should understand Montesquieu’s claim and conviction that he had made a “stupendous discovery’’ — i.e., that “for the ®rst time in human history, he had uncovered the fundamental laws which govern the behaviour of human societies, much as natural scientists in the previous century had discovered the laws of the behaviour of inanimate matter’’ (Berlin 1980b: 134). “Those who assert that a blind fatality produced the various effects we behold in this world talk very absurdly,’’ Montesquieu asserted, “for can any thing be more unreasonable than to pretend that a blind fatality could be productive of intelligent beings?’’ (1949: 1). Social things, like natural things, were seen to be subject neither to chance nor to fate. Human behavior was intelligible, and once its laws were understood, a science of man was possible. This, in turn, would create the foundation for the rational science of government, one that would ®t means to ends in accordance with principles derived from experience and observation.

正是在这种背景下，我们才能理解孟德斯鸠的主张和信念，即他做出了一个“惊人的发现”ーー也就是说，“在人类历史上，他第一次发现了支配人类社会行为的基本规律，就像上个世纪自然科学家发现了无生命物质行为的规律一样”(柏林1980b: 134)。“那些断言盲目的死亡造成了我们在这个世界上所看到的各种影响的人说话非常荒谬,”孟德斯鸠断言，“因为还有什么比假装盲目的死亡能够产生智慧生物更不合理的吗?”(1949:1).人们认为社会事物和自然事物一样，既不受机会的支配，也不受命运的支配。人类的行为是可以理解的，一旦理解了它的规律，人类科学就成为可能。这反过来又将为政府的理性科学奠定基础，这种科学将意味着根据经验和观察得出的原则达到目的。

Much of this, of course, was consistent with Enlightenment optimism and its underlying faith in science and education, political reform and social progress. But throughout Montesquieu’s work, there was also a more skeptical mood. Some of his opinions on speci®c social and political questions irritated the Encyclopedists, who became concerned about his reservations regarding the perfectibility of man and society, and thus suspicious of his commitment to their ideals. Montesquieu’s 18th- and 19th-century critics ascribed this reticence to his timidity, and also to his “natural conservatism”; but a more likely explanation is his deeply felt attraction for the writings of Montaigne, a fellow-Gascon and aristocrat whose intellectual traits — e.g., an urbane skepticism, a facility for unmasking illusions, subjective empiricism, a repugnance for religious fanaticism, and a feeling for the diversity of customs and the richness of natural forms — he also shared (Hulliung 1976: 113—14). Neumann thus argues that Montesquieu always read Descartes “through the skepticism of Montaigne,’’ and that this has been “inadequately stressed’’ by other scholars and commentators (1949a: xviii — xix, xxxiii).

当然，其中大部分与启蒙运动的乐观主义及其对科学和教育、政治改革和社会进步的根本信念是一致的。但在孟德斯鸠的整个研究过程中，也存在着一种更为怀疑的情绪。他对特定的社会和政治问题的一些观点激怒了百科全书学者，他们开始担心他对人和社会的完美性的保留意见，因此怀疑他对他们理想的承诺。孟德斯鸠18世纪和19世纪的批评家将这种沉默归因于他的胆怯和“天生的保守主义”，但更可能的解释是他对蒙田作品的深深吸引力。蒙田是一个加斯科尼人，也是一个贵族，他的知识特征ーー比如，温文尔雅的怀疑主义、揭露幻想的能力、主观的经验主义、对宗教狂热的反感，以及对风俗多样性和自然形式丰富性的感受ーー他也分享了这种感受(胡良1976:113ー14)。因此，诺依曼认为，孟德斯鸠总是“通过蒙田的怀疑主义”来解读笛卡尔，而其他学者和评论家对此“强调不够”(1949a: xviii ー xix，xxxiii)。

Berlin argues that this skepticism penetrates to the very core of Montesquieu’s thought and explains its internal contradictions, while simultaneously raising the stature of De l'esprit des lois far above the more optimistic works and radical proposals of his Enlightenment contemporaries. “By temperament,’’ he observes, “Montesquieu is an empiricist who seeks to explain everything by naturalistic means wherever and whenever he can” (1980b: 137). This is not to say that he entirely avoided metaphysical concepts; on the contrary, De l'esprit des lois ± as its famous opening lines testify ± reeks of the language of natural law. But what Montesquieu principally stressed, Berlin insists, was the fruit of observation:

柏林认为，这种怀疑主义深入到孟德斯鸠思想的核心，并解释了其内部矛盾，同时提高了论法的精神的地位，远远超过了他的同时代启蒙运动更为乐观的作品和激进的建议。“按照性格,”他评论道，“孟德斯鸠是一个经验主义者，无论何时何地，只要他可以，他都试图用自然主义的方法来解释一切”(1980b: 137)。这并不是说他完全回避了形而上学的概念，相反，论法的精神的著名开场白证明了自然法则语言的臭味。但德国政府坚称，孟德斯鸠政府主要强调的是观察的结果:

He observed curiously, minutely and insatiably, all his life. His accounts of his travels, his historical sketches, his scattered notes on a wide variety of topics, are detailed, vivid and penetrating. He was fascinated by what he saw and what he learnt, for its own sake, whether or not it offered evidence for a hypothesis or pointed a moral that he wished to emphasise. (1980b: 137)

他一生都在好奇地、细致地、贪婪地观察着。他的旅行记录，他的历史速写，他的零散笔记在各种各样的主题，是详细的，生动的和精辟的。他着迷于自己所看到的和所学到的东西，不管这些东西是否为一个假设提供了证据，或者是否指向了一个他想强调的道德观。(1980b: 137)

This in turn explains certain features of Montesquieu’s works. His descriptions of characters and events are neither the caricatures nor the consciously idealized exaggerations typical of 18th-century literature. Usbek and Rica of the Lettres persanes (1721), for example, are characterized not as superior or inferior to Parisians, but rather as utterly dissimilar, representing the sheer, irreducible variety of practice, habit, and custom, so that what is obvious and “normal” in one culture appears ludicrous and perverse in the other. Similarly, despite its posture as a systematic, logically constructed political treatise, De l'esprit des lois abounds in sudden digressions and episodic asides, ostensibly called forth as evidence in support of more general laws and hypotheses, but which rather reflect Montesquieu’s fascination for the particular, the detailed, and the concrete. The resulting chaos has been acknowledged by many scholars ± “initial bewilderment,” Franz Neumann once observed, “is the inevitable fate of every reader of The Spirit of the Laws’ (1949a: xxxi). Recognizing that it “would be ungenerous to disparage the devoted labours of so many scholars and commentators,” Berlin asks if this is not “all so much misdirected ingenuity,’’ for

这反过来解释了孟德斯鸠作品的某些特点。他对人物和事件的描写既不是讽刺漫画，也不是18世纪文学典型的有意识的理想化夸张。例如，1721年的波斯人信札乌斯别克斯坦和黎加，其特征不是优于或低于巴黎人，而是完全不同，代表着纯粹的、不可还原的各种实践、习惯和习俗，因此，在一种文化中显而易见的“正常”在另一种文化中显得荒唐和反常。同样，尽管它的姿态是一个系统的，逻辑构建的政治论文，论法的精神中充满了突然的离题和插曲，表面上被称为支持更一般的法律和假设的证据，但这反映了孟德斯鸠对特定的，详细的，具体的迷恋。弗朗茨 · 诺依曼(Franz Neumann)曾经说过，由此产生的混乱已经被许多学者承认为“最初的困惑”，“是《法律的精神》(The Spirit of The Law，1949a: xxxi)的每一位读者不可避免的命运。柏林认识到，“贬低如此多学者和评论家的奉献精神是不厚道的”，他问道，这是不是“所有这些错误的独创性”

Montesquieu is not a systematic philosopher, not a deductive thinker, not a historian, not a scientist, and one of his great merits lies in the fact that although he claims to be founding a new science in the spirit of Descartes, his practice is better than his professions, and he is, in fact, doing nothing of the kind, because he realises that the material will not allow it.

孟德斯鸠不是一个系统的哲学家，不是一个演绎思想家，不是一个历史学家，不是一个科学家，他最大的优点之一在于，尽管他声称自己是在笛卡尔的精神下创立了一门新的科学，但他的实践比他的专业更好，事实上，他什么也没做，因为他意识到材料是不允许的。

In short, if Montesquieu’s “stupendous discovery’’ included the notion that social facts could be studied scientifically, it equally included his recognition that the attempt to impose upon these facts some preestablished, metaphysical conception was “an excessively artificial proceeding, repugnant to the nature of this particular topic,” one which would “turn out, as later sociology has all too often proved to be, exceedingly sterile in results” (1980b: 138).

简而言之，如果说孟德斯鸠的“惊人发现”包括了社会事实可以被科学地研究的概念，那么它同样包括了他的这样一种认识，即试图将某种预先建立的形而上学概念强加于这些事实之上是“一种过于人为的过程，与这一特定主题的本质相悖”，这种过程将“结果证明，正如后来的社会学经常被证明的那样，结果是极其徒劳无益的”(1980b: 138)。

But if the concrete particularities of human experience were thus resistant, by their very nature, to the abstract, metaphysical concepts of French rationalism, what was Montesquieu’s method? “For all that Montesquieu speaks of Cartesian methods,’’ Berlin assures us, “he does not, fortunately for himself and posterity, apply them.’’ Instead, he advances “tentative principles and hypotheses,” defends them by “adducing the never wholly conclusive evidence of observation,” and uses them “in the manner which the subject-matter seems to call for.’’ Montesquieu’s famous attack on Hobbes’ state of nature and the social contract, his conception of societies as analogous to biological organisms, his notion of different social and psychological “types” - all were “bold and fruitful notions,’’ Berlin admits, but ones that “rested on apergus and unsystematic observations dominated by moral purpose, not on careful and exhaustive, morally neutral researches like those made by his contemporaries Buffon and Linnaeus’’ (1980b: 138, 40).

但是，如果人类经验的具体特殊性本质上抵制法国理性主义的抽象的形而上学概念，那么孟德斯鸠的方法是什么呢？“尽管孟德斯鸠大谈笛卡尔的方法,”柏林向我们保证，“但幸运的是，他自己和子孙后代都没有应用笛卡尔的方法。”相反，他提出了“试探性的原则和假设”，通过“引用从来没有完全结论性的观察证据”来为它们辩护，并且“以主题似乎要求的方式”使用它们孟德斯鸠对霍布斯的自然状态和社会契约的著名攻击，他对社会的概念类似于生物有机体，他对不同的社会和心理“类型”的概念——所有这些都是“大胆和富有成效的概念,”柏林承认，但是这些“依赖于道德目的主导的无系统的观察，而不是像他同时代的布冯和林奈所做的那样，依赖于仔细和详尽的道德中立的研究”(1980b: 138,40)。

The heart and soul of these apergus and observations (as Durkheim recognized so well) was Montesquieu’s classihcation of societal “types’’ - i.e., despotism, monarchy, and republic (the latter subdivided into democracies and aristocracies) (1949: 8-18). The classihcation was an attempt to improve upon Aristotle’s, and it owes an equal debt to the ancient, metaphysical doctrine of natural kinds. Each of these societal types thus possesses its own distinctive “principle’’ or “inner force’’ (i.e., the principle of despotism is fear, that of monarchy, honor, of democracy, virtue, and of aristocracy, moderation) which enables it to function as it does (1949: 19-28). Each principle quite naturally rehects the physical circumstances and material conditions (e.g., climate, topography, population size and density, etc.) of the society in question; but Berlin emphasizes the extent to which Montesquieu’s model here is biological rather than chemical, depends upon hnal rather than mechanical causes, and was thus precisely the one which had been abandoned by the “new science’’ of Galileo and Newton (1980b: 140—1). This is important because Durkheim recognized it instantly, and it became the basis of his most important objection to De l’esprit des lois, one rehected in both the Latin thesis and De la division du travail social. The laws appropriate to a particular society, Montesquieu insisted, should always relate to the principle of its distinctive type: “The relation of laws to this principle,” Montesquieu explained, “strengthens the several springs of government; and this principle derives thence, in its turn, a new degree of vigor” (1949: 40). Inversely, when laws ignore or contradict a society’s “inner principle,” the society becomes liable to decay and disaster (1949: 109-25).

这些阿珀格斯和观察的核心和灵魂(迪尔凯姆很好地认识到这一点)是孟德斯鸠对社会“类型”的分类——即，专制、君主制和共和国(后者又细分为民主国家和贵族国家)(1949:8-18)。这种分类法是对亚里士多德的分类法的一种改进，它同样受到古代自然种类的形而上学教义的影响。因此，这些社会类型中的每一种都拥有自己独特的“原则”或“内在力量”(即，专制主义的原则是恐惧，即君主制、荣誉、民主、美德和贵族制、节制) ，这使它能够发挥作用(1949:19-28)。每一个原则都很自然地反映了所讨论的社会的物理环境和物质条件(如气候、地形、人口规模和密度等) ，但是柏林强调孟德斯鸠的模型在很大程度上是生物的而不是化学的，依赖于 hnal 而不是机械的原因，因此正是伽利略和牛顿的“新科学”所抛弃的那个。这一点很重要，因为迪尔凯姆立刻就意识到了这一点，并且这一点成为了他反对论法的精神的最重要理由的基础，这一理由在拉丁文论文和《社会劳动分工》中都得到了反驳。孟德斯鸠坚持认为，适用于特定社会的法律应该始终与其独特类型的原则相关联: “法律与这一原则的关系,”孟德斯鸠解释说，“加强了政府的几个源泉，而这一原则又从中衍生出一种新的活力”(1949:40)。相反，当法律忽视或者违背一个社会的“内在原则”时，这个社会就变得容易衰退和灾难(1949:109-25)。

The simile of intelligent legislation, as with Aristotle and also with Durkheim, was thus medical: “The business of legislators and administrators, judges, and of everyone concerned with social issues in any form, is to preserve, maintain, improve the health of society’’ (Berlin 1980b: 141). But Montesquieu was unusual among his Enlightenment contemporaries, Berlin emphasizes, in his insistence that what constitutes this societal “health” will vary from one society to another, according to its particular environment and the distinctive inner “principle” which guides its response to these conditions. While the Encyclopedists and philosophes struggled to ®nd some objective criterion or abstract, universal standard in the light of which a “good” society or institution might be known, Montesquieu - like a good physician - was content to observe carefully, to recognize things for what they are, and to make recommendations accordingly (Berlin 1980b: 142—3).

正如亚里士多德和涂尔干一样，明智立法的比喻也是医学上的: “立法者、行政人员、法官以及所有关心任何形式社会问题的人的职责就是维护、保持、改善社会的健康”(柏林1980b: 141)。但是孟德斯鸠在他的启蒙时代是不同寻常的，柏林强调，在他坚持什么构成这种社会“健康”将不同于另一个社会，根据其特定的环境和独特的内在“原则”，指导其对这些条件的反应。当百科全书家和哲学家们努力寻找一些客观的标准或抽象的、普遍的标准，根据这些标准，一个“好”的社会或机构可能会被认识，孟德斯鸠——就像一个好的医生——满足于仔细观察，认识事物的本质，并据此提出建议(柏林1980b: 142ー3)。

This taste for what was real and concrete rather than ideal and abstract left Montesquieu open to charges of moral relativism and indifference to ultimate values, from both radicals and reactionaries. “There are many local laws in various religions,’’ an example of Montesquieu’s offense against the latter began, “and when Montezuma with so much obstinacy insisted that the religion of the Spaniards was good for their country, and his for Mexico, he did not assert an absurdity; because, in fact, legislators could never help having a regard to what nature had established before them’’ (1949: 42). De l'esprit des lois offended the Encyclopedists and philosophes as well, not simply through its skeptical, Montaignian mood, but also because of its opposition to any universal criterion of rationality, which — like Durkheim’s argument in Les Formes elementaires (1912) — subverted any effort to show that all religions were tissues of falsehood (1915: 13—15). Voltaire and Helvetius were no less frustrated by Montesquieu’s sense — deeply felt by Durkheim — of the sheer complexity of concrete social phenomena, which led him to resist simple, radical solutions for fear of their unpredictable consequences (Berlin 1980b: 146—7).

这种对真实、具体而非理想和抽象的品味，让孟德斯鸠面临激进分子和反动派的道德相对主义和对终极价值观的漠视。“各种宗教都有许多当地法律,”孟德斯鸠反对后者的一个例子是这样开头的，“当蒙特祖马如此顽固地坚持认为西班牙人的宗教对他们的国家有好处，而他的宗教对墨西哥有好处时，他并没有断言这是荒谬的，因为事实上，立法者从来不会不顾及自然在他们之前建立的东西。”(1949:42)。论法的精神也冒犯了百科全书作家和哲学家，不仅仅是因为它的怀疑主义、蒙田式的情绪，还因为它反对任何普遍的合理性标准，就像涂尔干在《 Les Formes 基本教义》(1912)中的论点一样，颠覆了任何证明所有宗教都是谎言组织的努力(1915:13ー15)。伏尔泰和赫尔维提乌斯对孟德斯鸠对具体社会现象的纯粹复杂性的感觉(迪尔凯姆对此深有体会)也同样感到沮丧，这种感觉导致迪尔凯姆抵制简单、激进的解决方案，因为他担心这些方案会带来不可预测的后果(柏林1980b: 146-7)。

Finally, while no hgure in the 18th century did more than Montesquieu to draw attention to the influence of material factors on society and culture, he never embraced an aggressively determi-nist position. In a manner more reminiscent of Max Weber, Montesquieu suggested that the laws that govern human behavior are somehow less binding than those that govern physical matter, that some material causes simply render certain social consequences “more probable” (not inevitable), and that these causes can, to a significant degree, be counteracted by deliberate human action. And the goal of such action was not some utopian state, but rather the preservation of an unstable equilibrium in which each law or force was checked by another, producing an “elaborate mosaic” of countervailing powers. This, of course, became Montesquieu’s most famous and influential idea — i.e., the notion of a constitutional “separation of powers’’ — inspired by his travels in England (1729—31) despite the fact that such a separation existed there no more than it did in France.[70](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark82)

最后，尽管在18世纪，没有什么比孟德斯鸠更能引起人们对物质因素对社会和文化的影响的关注，但他从未采取过激进的决定论立场。在某种程度上让人想起马克斯 · 韦伯，孟德斯鸠认为，管理人类行为的法律在某种程度上比管理物质的法律更没有约束力，一些物质原因只是使某些社会后果“更可能”(而不是不可避免) ，这些原因在很大程度上可以被人类有意识的行为抵消。这种行动的目标不是某种乌托邦式的国家，而是保持一种不稳定的平衡，在这种平衡中，每一种法律或力量都受到另一种法律或力量的制约，从而产生一种“精心设计的马赛克”式的反补贴力量。当然，这成为了孟德斯鸠最著名和最有影响力的观点ーー也就是宪法“权力分立”的概念ーー灵感来自他在英国的旅行(1729年至1731年) ，尽管那里存在的这种分离并不比法国多。70

This brings us to the subject of liberty, which the separation of powers was designed to protect. “It is true that in democracies the people seem to act as they please,’’ Montesquieu acknowledged in book XI, “but political liberty does not consist in an unlimited freedom. In governments, that is, in societies directed by laws, liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to will, and in not being constrained to do what we ought not to will.’’ Liberty, in short, is “a right of doing whatever the laws permit’’ (1949: 150). But if liberty is thus the freedom to act unless such an act is prohibited by law, Neumann is quite right to suggest that “the character of the restraining laws must necessarily move into the center of his theory’’ (1949a: l). What underlies these laws and renders them legitimate, especially in so far as they are taken as setting the parameters of human liberty? What are we to make of the possibility of an unjust law which, by this conception, we have no right to violate?

这就把我们带到了自由这个问题上，这个权力分立是为了保护自由而设计的。“的确，在民主国家，人民似乎随心所欲,”孟德斯鸠在《第十一卷》(book XI)中承认，“但政治自由并不包括无限的自由。在政府中，也就是在法律指导下的社会中，自由只能存在于做我们应该做的事情的权力中，而不是被限制去做我们不应该做的事情。”简而言之，自由是“做法律允许的任何事情的权利”(1949:150)。但是，如果自由因此是行动的自由，除非这样的行为被法律禁止，诺依曼是相当正确的建议，“约束法律的性质必须进入他的理论的中心”(1949a: l)。这些法律的基础是什么并使其合法化，特别是在它们被视为确定人类自由的参数的情况下？根据这个概念，我们没有权利违反一项不公正的法律，我们该如何看待这种可能性呢？

Montesquieu’s answers to these and other questions about liberty and justice indicate how deeply he was still indebted to the ancient and medieval tradition of natural law. “Before laws were made,’’ Montesquieu insisted in book I, “there were relations of possible justice. To say there is nothing just or unjust but what is commanded or forbidden by positive law, is the same as saying that before the describing of a circle all the radii were not equal'' (1949: 2). In a completely rational society, therefore, unjust laws would not exist, for all laws would conform to natural law. But “the intelligent world,'' Montesquieu added, “is far from being so well governed as the physical.'' No human society is capable of fully realizing this natural standard of absolute justice. Montesquieu's discussions of the various types of government are thus attempts to find approximations of natural law, with particular attention to those conditions - climatic, topographic, demographic, social, and psychological — which render these approximations incomplete and unsatisfactory. For Montesquieu, civil society itself thus became an agent of history, and the proper focus of sociological study (Neumann 1949a: xxxix—xl).

孟德斯鸠对这些以及其他有关自由和正义的问题的回答表明，他仍深深感激古代和中世纪的自然法传统。“在法律制定之前,”孟德斯鸠在第一卷中坚称，“存在可能的正义关系。说没有什么是正义的或不正义的，但是什么是被正定律所命令或禁止的，就等于说在描述一个圆之前，所有的半径是不相等的”(1949:2)。因此，在一个完全理性的社会里，不公正的法律是不存在的，因为所有的法律都符合自然法则。但是“智慧世界,”孟德斯鸠补充道，“远没有物质世界管理得那么好。”没有一个人类社会能够充分实现这种绝对正义的自然标准。因此，孟德斯鸠关于各种类型政府的讨论试图找到自然法则的近似值，并特别关注气候、地形、人口、社会和心理等条件，这些条件使这些近似值变得不完整和不令人满意。对孟德斯鸠来说，公民社会本身也因此成为历史的媒介，成为社会学研究的重点(诺依曼1949a: xxxix ー xl)。

The tension — if not downright contradiction — between these two themes in De I'esprit des lois has been a focus of Montesquieu's critics at least since Hume's Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751) (1975: 196—7, 197 n. 1). On the one hand, Montesquieu invoked the rationalist doctrine that positive law must always be measured against the standard of some transcendent set of metaphysical principles. On the other, with stunning originality, he introduced the more empiricist doctrine that laws are the evolving expression of the largely unconscious moral habits, beliefs, and attitudes of particular societies at particular times and places, which themselves reflect the speci®c material conditions in which they emerged. The ®rst represented the Roman and Napoleonic tradition of codified law, committed to the application of general principles whose validity was regarded as timeless and universal. The second — as we've seen in chapter 4 (pp. 185—209) — reflected a more conservative, pragmatic tradition, epitomized in German jurisprudence, in which law was the organic expression of the deepest traditions of a nation, culture, or community, not to be deflected by arbitrary and arti®cial reforms (Berlin 1980b: 156).

至少自休谟《道德原则的调查》(1751)(1975:196-7,197 n. 1)以来，《法律的精神》中这两个主题之间的紧张关系(如果不是彻头彻尾的矛盾的话)一直是孟德斯鸠批评家关注的焦点。一方面，孟德斯鸠援引理性主义学说，即实在法必须始终以某些超越形而上学原则的标准来衡量。另一方面，他以惊人的独创性，引入了更多的经验主义学说，即法律是在特定时间和地点特定社会基本上无意识的道德习惯、信仰和态度的进化表达，它们本身反映了它们出现的特定物质条件。第一个代表了罗马和拿破仑的成文法传统，致力于适用一般原则，其有效性被认为是永恒和普遍的。第二种——正如我们在第四章(第185-209页)中看到的——反映了一种更为保守、务实的传统，这种传统在德国法理学中得到了体现。在德国法理学中，法律是一个民族、文化或社区最深层传统的有机表达，不会被武断和人为的改革所扭曲(柏林1980b: 156)。

The same ambivalence can be seen in Montesquieu's use of important words like reason and nature. In his more rationalist moods, for example, Montesquieu uses “reason” in the manner of Descartes, i.e., to refer to the intuitive perception of general laws; but in other, more empiricist moods, it seems to refer to a more pragmatic grasp of what a particular society needs in order to adapt to speci®c conditions and circumstances. Similarly, in the Cartesian context, “nature” takes revenge on those who legislate in ignorance of or indifference to natural law; but in other contexts, nature is simply the way things are, the material causes of particular institutions adapted to them, and thus the proper subject of sociological investigation. In all of Montesquieu’s writings, Berlin thus emphasizes, there is “a kind of continuous dialectic . . . between absolute values which seem to correspond to the permanent interests of men as such, and those which depend upon time and place in a concrete situation’’ (1980b: 157).

同样的矛盾心理可以在孟德斯鸠对理性和自然等重要词汇的使用中看到。例如，在他更为理性的情绪中，孟德斯鸠以笛卡尔的方式使用“理性”，即指对一般法则的直觉感知，但在其他更为经验主义的情绪中，它似乎指对特定社会需要什么以适应特定条件和环境的更为务实的把握。同样，在笛卡尔的语境中，“自然”报复那些无视或漠视自然法的立法者; 但在其他语境中，自然只是事物本来的样子，特定制度适应它们的物质原因，因此是社会学研究的适当主体。因此，在孟德斯鸠所有的著作中，柏林强调，“在似乎符合人类永久利益的绝对价值观与那些取决于具体情况中的时间和地点的绝对价值观之间，存在着一种持续的辩证法”(1980b: 157)。

Montesquieu’s ambivalence here was no less obvious to Durkheim than it had been to Hume. On the contrary, it made De 1’esprit des lois the perfect forge in which Durkheim would shape the tools he would use in De la division du travail social and later works. For, as we’ve seen above (pp. 77—8), Durkheim, like Montesquieu, was troubled by the legacy of Cartesian metaphysics and, again like Montesquieu, sought to temper its emphasis on “clear and distinct ideas’’ with a language more responsive to the concrete complexity of things. The Latin thesis is thus an extended exploration of the relative merits of rationalism and empiricism, of realism and nominalism, and (indirectly) of the relative contributions of their French and German progenitors. Alluding to “the leading modern writers’’ from Britain and Germany, for example, Durkheim denied that social science is “foreign to our ways and to the French temperament,” adding that among the writers of the French Enlightenment, Montesquieu “stands far above them all,’’ for no one before him “had seen so clearly the conditions necessary for establishing this science.’’[71](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark83) The hrst of these conditions — already evident in the Sens lectures — is a specihc subject matter different from the other sciences: “No discipline merits the name of science,’’ Durkheim observed, “that does not have a dehnite, limited subject matter to investigate.’’ Second, this held must be comprised, not simply of ideas, nor even of our ideas of things, but of things themselves. “Science is concerned with things,” Durkheim insisted. “Without a given to describe and explain, it exists in a void and it cannot set itself any goal beyond this description and explanation” (1997: 11e).

在迪尔凯姆看来，孟德斯鸠的矛盾心理不亚于休谟。相反，它使《法的精神》成为涂尔干塑造他在《社会劳动分工》和后期作品中所使用的工具的完美锻造工具。因为，正如我们在上面看到的(77ー8页) ，迪尔凯姆，像孟德斯鸠一样，被笛卡尔形而上学的遗产所困扰，并且，像孟德斯鸠一样，试图用一种更能回应事物的具体复杂性的语言来缓和它对“清晰而独特的思想”的强调。因此，拉丁文论文是对理性主义和经验主义、现实主义和唯名论的相对优点，以及(间接地)他们的法国和德国祖先的相对贡献的扩展探索。例如，迪尔凯姆暗指来自英国和德国的“现代主要作家”，他否认社会科学“与我们的方式和法国人的性格格格不入”，并补充说，在法国启蒙运动的作家中，孟德斯鸠“远远超过他们”，因为在他之前，没有人“如此清楚地看到建立这门科学的必要条件”71这些条件中最重要的ーー在森斯的讲座中已经很明显ーー是一个不同于其他科学的特殊主题: “没有哪个学科能够配得上科学的名字,”涂尔干评论道，“它没有一个可供研究的有限的主题。”其次，这必须包括，不仅仅是思想，甚至不是我们对事物的思想，而是事物本身。“科学与事物有关,”涂尔干坚持说。“没有一个给定的描述和解释，它存在于一个空白，它不能设定自己的任何目标超出这个描述和解释”(1997:11e)。

Social science is thus the scienti®c study of social things (choses sociales) ± e.g., laws, customs, religions, suicide rates, the division of labor, etc. ± which, like the other things in nature, have their own peculiar characteristics. But until quite recently, Durkheim insisted, no philosopher had viewed the things studied by social science in this way. Durkheim acknowledged that Aristotle ± whose Ethics and Politics he had taught at the university of Bordeaux ± was more an “empiricist” than was Plato; but Aristotle’s real concern was less with the discovery of the laws of social life than with the determination of the best form of society. Aristotle’s Ethics thus begins with the argument that happiness is the purpose of life, and that the goal of society should be to provide the context through which this end might reasonably be achieved ± i.e., through the practice of the virtues. But this, Durkheim observed, is not a goal that societies actually pursue; rather, it is the way societies should be organized if they are to assist their members in the realization of their specihc telos; and when Aristotle eventually did turn to historical facts, it was only to show how his original principles might be adapted to various situations. And, like Aristotle, later writers down to Montesquieu had continued to think that social phenomena were dependent on human will, and thus they “did not regard them as really things, just like other things in nature, which have their own characteristics and which therefore require sciences able to describe and explain them.’’[72](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark84)

因此，社会科学是对社会事物(选择社会)的科学研究，例如，法律、习俗、宗教、自杀率、劳动分工等等。但涂尔干坚持认为，直到最近，还没有哲学家以这种方式看待社会科学所研究的事物。涂尔干承认，亚里士多德在波尔多大学教授的伦理学和政治学更像是一个“经验主义者”，而不是柏拉图，但亚里士多德真正关心的不是社会生活规律的发现，而是社会最佳形式的决定。因此，亚里士多德的伦理学开始于这样一个论点，即幸福是生活的目的，社会的目标应该是提供一个环境，通过这个环境，这个目的可以合理地实现 ± ，也就是说，通过美德的实践。但是，涂尔干注意到，这并不是社会实际追求的目标; 相反，这是社会应该组织的方式，如果他们要帮助其成员实现他们的特定目标; 当亚里士多德最终转向历史事实，这只是表明他的原始原则可能适应各种情况。而且，像亚里士多德一样，后来到孟德斯鸠的作家们继续认为社会现象依赖于人类的意志，因此他们“不把它们当作真正的事物，就像自然界的其他事物一样，它们有自己的特点，因此需要科学能够描述和解释它们。”72

While Durkheim thus disparaged Montesquieu’s predecessors for practicing “not a science but an art,’’ he was clearly not suggesting that their formulations were in any sense irrational. On the contrary, their preferences for one form of the state over another were typically conjoined with rational demonstrations and even “proofs” ± e.g., that a particular preference was more “consonant with human nature’’ than its counterparts ± a style of argument Durkheim characterized as a kind of “science within art’’ (see Boutroux 1914: 188±94, esp. 190±1). But in what amounts to a sweeping indictment of one of the favorite arguments of Enlightenment social and political thought, Durkheim insisted that the deduction of such preferences from the abstract principles of human nature is psychology rather than social science, indeed, that such arguments rarely contain anything that is “social” at all. Interestingly, this argument - i.e., that at least until the 18th century, society was viewed as a work of art rather than of nature — was developed at length in Boutroux’s De 1’idee de loi naturelle dans la science et la philosophie contemporaines (1892). Unlike Durkheim, however, Boutroux saw Montesquieu as a more typical representative of Enlightenment rationalism, with a Cartesian, mathematical conception of society. In any case, for Durkheim, “true” science asserts its complete independence from art, divorces itself from immediate questions of utility, and applies itself to the description and classihcation of concrete things. For Durkheim, therefore, social facts are “willindependent” even where they are “mind-dependent,” and they are resistant to change at will collectively rather than merely individually (Miller 1997a: 101; 1996: 47).

尽管迪尔凯姆因此贬低了孟德斯鸠前辈们“不是科学而是艺术”的实践，但他显然不是在暗示他们的公式在任何意义上都是非理性的。相反，他们对一种国家形式的偏好通常与理性的论证甚至“证据”相结合，例如，一种特定的偏好比其对应的论证更“符合人性”，涂尔干的论证风格被描述为一种“艺术中的科学”(见布特鲁克斯1914:188 ± 94，尤其是。190 ± 1).但是，在对启蒙运动社会和政治思想中最受欢迎的论点之一的全面控诉中，涂尔干坚持认为，从人性的抽象原则中推断出这种偏好是心理学，而不是社会科学，事实上，这种论点很少包含任何“社会”的东西。有趣的是，这种观点——即至少在18世纪之前，社会被视为一种艺术而不是自然的产物——在布特鲁克斯的《当代科学与哲学中的自然法观》(1892)中得到了详尽的阐述。然而，与涂尔干不同的是，布特鲁克斯将孟德斯鸠视为启蒙运动理性主义的一个更典型的代表，具有笛卡尔式的社会数学概念。在任何情况下，对涂尔干来说，“真正的”科学主张它完全独立于艺术，脱离了直接的功利问题，并将自己应用于具体事物的描述和分类。因此，对于涂尔干来说，社会事实是“意志独立的”，即使它们是“思想依赖的”，它们抵制随意改变，而不仅仅是个人改变(Miller 1997a: 101; 1996:47)。

Where rationalists habitually began with axiomatic principles from which formal propositions were then deduced, therefore, Durkheim insisted that social science begin with the description of the things with which it deals. Here, “description” meant to characterize or dehne the things under investigation according to the features held in common with other things — in short, description presupposes classihcation. Only if the inhnite variety of nature can be foreshortened and reduced to specihc types, therefore, can social science proceed. Here again, Durkheim’s debt was to Aristotle’s Politics, with its classihcation of the types of the state; but Aristotle — unlike Montesquieu — had classihed societies only according to their for ms of government, thus ignoring religion, the family, economic life, etc. So again, Durkheim saw Montesquieu as breaking with a tradition of classihcation that went back to the ancient Greeks (1997: 16e— 17e).

理性主义者习惯性地从公理原则开始，然后从这些公理原则中推导出形式命题，因此，涂尔干坚持认为社会科学从描述它所处理的事物开始。在这里，“描述”是指根据与其他事物相同的特征来描述或划分被研究的事物ーー简而言之，描述是以分类为前提的。因此，只有缩短自然界的本质类型，将其归纳为特定的类型，社会科学才能进行下去。同样，迪尔凯姆欠亚里士多德的政治学，因为它对国家的类型进行了分类，但亚里士多德ーー不像孟德斯鸠ーー只是根据社会对政府的类型进行了分类，从而忽略了宗教、家庭、经济生活等等。因此，迪尔凯姆再次认为孟德斯鸠打破了古希腊的分类传统(1997:16e ー17e)。

This observation brought Durkheim to a question similar to one discussed a decade earlier in the Sens lectures. Is classihcation, he asked, a wholly inductive procedure, “socially constructed” by social scientists themselves? Or are these societal types somehow “given” by nature itself, and only later apprehended by the human mind? This is a complicated question, and one to which Durkheim’s answers were not always consistent; but at least one generalization seems justihed. When Durkheim spoke of the way in which human subjects (particularly primitive subjects) “organize” their social world, he was almost determinedly constructivist, speaking an empiricist language that eventually resulted in his seminal contributions to the sociology of knowledge and science (Durkheim and Mauss 1963; Durkheim 1915). But when Durkheim spoke of the way in which social scientists (qua social scientists) understand and explain the social world, he spoke a more rationalist language of the order inherent in nature itself, which it is the job of social science to discover and comprehend.

这一观察使涂尔干提出了一个类似于十年前森斯讲座中讨论过的问题。他问道，分类是一个完全归纳的过程，是由社会科学家自己“社会建构”的吗？或者这些社会类型是大自然本身以某种方式“赋予”的，只是后来才被人类意识所理解？这是一个复杂的问题，涂尔干的回答并不总是一致的，但至少有一个概括似乎是公正的。当涂尔干谈到人类主体(特别是原始主体)“组织”他们的社会世界的方式时，他几乎是坚定的建构主义者，说的是经验主义的语言，最终导致了他对知识社会学和科学的开创性贡献(涂尔干和毛斯1963年; 涂尔干1915年)。但是，当涂尔干谈到社会科学家(作为社会科学家)理解和解释社会世界的方式时，他使用了一种更为理性主义的语言来描述自然本身固有的秩序，这是社会科学发现和理解的工作。

This was certainly the case when, in the Latin thesis, Durkheim turned to the problem of explanation (i.e., the arranging of our ideas in a de®nite order), the next step after description in his social scientific method. For this “definite order,” Durkheim argued, “involves the existence of such an order in things themselves — that is, the existence of unbroken chains, made up of parts which are so interlinked that every effect always follows necessarily from the same cause and cannot arise from others” (1997: 17e). In short, this requirement presupposes that social things are governed by laws, to the extent that without its being satisfied, no social science is possible. Among Durkheim’s conditions, therefore, laws are as essential to explanation as classification is to description. In fact, Durkheim never tired of insisting that human societies are a part of nature; and since laws govern all other parts of nature, it seemed clear to him — as to Montesquieu — that they govern human societies as well.

在拉丁文论文中，迪尔凯姆转向解释问题(即，将我们的思想按照神圣的次序排列) ，在他的社会科学方法的描述之后的下一步，当然就是这种情况。因为这种“确定的秩序”，涂尔干认为，“涉及到事物本身存在这样一种秩序ーー也就是说，不间断的链条的存在，这些链条是由相互联系的部分组成的，每一种结果都必然来自同一个原因，而不能来自其他原因”(1997:17e)。简而言之，这一要求的前提是，社会事物是由法律支配的，在某种程度上，如果没有法律的满足，就不可能有社会科学。因此，在涂尔干的条件中，法律对于解释的重要性就如同分类对于描述的重要性一样。事实上，迪尔凯姆从不厌倦地坚持人类社会是自然的一部分，而且由于法律支配着自然的所有其他部分，他似乎很清楚，对于孟德斯鸠来说，法律也支配着人类社会。

This insistence that social phenomena are governed by laws inevitably raised another question discussed in the Sens lectures — i.e., if social phenomena are bound by laws of cause and effect, what becomes of free will? The view that the idea of law is thus in conflict with that of free will, Durkheim observed, has been one of the major obstacles to the emergence of social science. The view that it is conscious motives that underlie our actions, that it is the individual wills and personalities of “kings, legislators, and prophets’’ that drive history forward, that it is the most visible causes of social phenomena that provide their appropriate explanation — this view, Durkheim argued, contradicts the very idea of a social science. First, the idea of natural societal “types” — i.e., of classes of things inherent within societies (themselves a part of nature) — presupposes the idea of causes which, “at work in different times and places, always and everywhere produce the same effects’’ (1997: 20e). Second, so long as it is assumed that “kings, legislators, and prophets” can direct social life according to their individual wills, then social science has no object; for the subject matter of social science can consist only of “things” that have a stable nature of their own, and are capable of resisting human will.

这种坚持认为社会现象受法律支配的观点，不可避免地引发了森斯讲座中讨论的另一个问题ーー即，如果社会现象受因果法则约束，自由意志会变成什么样子？迪尔凯姆观察到，认为法律观念因此与自由意志观念相冲突的观点，一直是社会科学出现的主要障碍之一。迪尔凯姆认为，有一种观点认为，我们的行为背后是有意识的动机，是“国王、立法者和先知”的个人意志和个性推动历史前进，是社会现象最明显的原因提供了适当的解释ーー这种观点与社会科学的理念本身是矛盾的。首先，自然社会“类型”的概念ーー即社会内部固有事物的类别(它们本身是自然的一部分)ーー预先假定了原因的概念，“在不同的时间和地点工作，总是和在任何地方产生同样的效果”(1997:20e)。其次，只要假定“国王、立法者、先知”能够按照自己的意志指导社会生活，那么社会科学就没有对象; 因为社会科学的主题只能是具有自身稳定性、能够抵制人类意志的“事物”。

But if this “scientihcally knowable” subject matter is a necessary condition for social science, Durkheim added, it is hardly sufficient to that purpose. In addition, Durkheim argued, we need a method which is both appropriate to the things studied, and consistent with the more general conditions of science. Here Durkheim seems to have had the psychological experiments he had observed in Wundt’s laboratory - “specialized,” “restricted,” “precise,” and “complex” (1887a: 433) - as his model. But if Durkheim thus considered controlled experimentation the virtual model of the scientific method, he also shared Comte’s conclusion that experiments were impossible in the study of human societies (1997: 21e). Some other method was thus required — one that met the austere criteria of science (i.e., description and classi®cation, interpretation and laws), but one also consistent with the nature of the subject matter under investigation (i.e., real, concrete, diverse, complex, etc.).

但迪尔凯姆补充说，如果这种“科学上可知”的主题是社会科学的必要条件，那么它几乎不足以达到这个目的。此外，涂尔干认为，我们需要一种既适合所研究的事物，又符合更一般的科学条件的方法。在这里，迪尔凯姆似乎有他在冯特的实验室里观察到的心理学实验——“专业化”、“受限制”、“精确”和“复杂”(1887a: 433)——作为他的模型。但是，如果涂尔干因此认为受控实验是科学方法的虚拟模型，他也同意孔德的结论，即实验在人类社会的研究中是不可能的(1997:21e)。因此需要一些其他的方法ーー一个符合严格的科学标准(即，描述和分类，解释和法律) ，但也符合被调查主题的性质(即，真实的，具体的，多样的，复杂的，等等)。

This had been the special contribution of Montesquieu. To Durkheim, the purpose of De 1’esprit des lois was clear — Montesquieu’s goal was to “investigate their nature,’’ to “seek their origins and find their causes, both in the physical domain and in that of the mind.’’[73](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark85) But what particularly impressed Durkheim were those elements of Montesquieu’s thought — e.g., book I, chapter 3, “Of the Principles of the Three Kinds of Government” — that set him apart from his Enlightenment contemporaries, and more closely resembled the 19th-century German concern for historical context and ethical relativity.[74](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark86) Where earlier philosophers were convinced that “a single form of state and a single legal and moral doctrine ®tted in with all men’s nature,’’ for example, Montesquieu understood that “rules of life differ according to the conditions of life.’’ Recognizing the diversity of societal types, Montesquieu considered all equally

这是孟德斯鸠的特殊贡献。对涂尔干来说，《法的精神》的目的很明确ーー孟德斯鸠的目标是“调查它们的本性”，“寻找它们的起源，找到它们的原因，无论是在物质领域还是在思想领域。”但给涂尔干印象最深刻的是孟德斯鸠思想的那些元素ーー例如，第一卷，第三章，“三种政府的原则”ーー使他与同时代的启蒙运动有所不同，更接近于19世纪德国对历史背景和伦理相对论的关注。例如，早期的哲学家相信“一种国家形式和一种与所有人的本性相联系的法律和道德教义”，而孟德斯鸠明白“生活的规则因生活条件的不同而不同。”认识到社会类型的多样性，孟德斯鸠平等地考虑了所有问题

“normal,” and refused to “lay down rules valid for all peoples.” And while Montesquieu clearly realized the advantages of one type of institution over another, these judgments were always rendered “in ter ms of norms which he derived from things themselves and which accordingly correspond with the diversity of things” (Durkheim 1997: 25e)-

“正常”，并拒绝“制定适用于所有民族的规则”虽然孟德斯鸠清楚地认识到一种制度相对于另一种制度的优势，但是这些判断总是以“他从事物本身衍生出来的规范的术语，并因此与事物的多样性相一致”(迪尔凯姆1997:25e)-

Montesquieu’s debt to the tradition of natural law notwithstanding, he was constantly ambivalent on its relation to the laws of civil society; and this ambivalence became the source of much of Durkheim’s admiration for De I'esprit des lois. It is true, Durkheim acknowledged, that Montesquieu recognized that societies are composed of individual human beings, that such beings have a “nature” that distinguishes them from other animals, and that the nature of human societies reflects this nature of its component parts. But it was precisely here that Montesquieu and Durkheim refused to reduce the explanation of social phenomena to psychological causes. The natural instincts that lead human beings into social relationships may “open[s] the way to society,’’ Durkheim argued, but they do not “produce its forms, nature, or laws. There is nothing about social institutions which can be explained by this approach’’ (1997: 26e). Montesquieu’s treatment of the problem of human nature, Durkheim thus emphasized, was “brief and sketchy,’’ for it “is not of direct concern to his project’’; and for the same reason, Montesquieu sharply separated “natural laws’’ — meaning the nature of individual human beings — from the civil, political, and international law of human societies.

尽管迪尔凯姆深受自然法传统的影响，但他始终对自然法与公民社会法的关系持矛盾态度，这种矛盾心理成为迪尔凯姆对《法律的精神》(De i’esprit des lois)赞赏的源泉。的确，迪尔凯姆承认，孟德斯鸠认识到社会是由个体的人组成的，这样的人有一种区别于其他动物的“自然”，人类社会的自然反映了其组成部分的这种自然。但正是在这里，孟德斯鸠和迪尔凯姆拒绝将社会现象的解释归结为心理原因。迪尔凯姆认为，引导人类进入社会关系的自然本能可能“打开了通往社会的道路”，但它们并不“产生其形式、自然或法律”。没有任何关于社会制度的东西可以用这种方法来解释”(1997:26e)。迪尔凯姆因此强调，孟德斯鸠对人性问题的处理是“简短而粗略的”，因为它“与他的计划没有直接关系”，同样的原因，孟德斯鸠将“自然法”ーー即个体人性ーー与人类社会的公民法、政治法和国际法严格区分开来。

What impressed Durkheim still more, however, was that Montesquieu — having thus refused to explain civil and political law as the consequence of human nature — equally refused to explain it by reference to an original agreement, contract, or convention. For such contracts and conventions, Durkheim argued, are artificial, have no place in nature, and thus subvert the very possibility of social science. In Montesquieu, by contrast, the laws of society “are founded in things in a different way from the others, as following from the nature, not of man, but of political societies. Their causes are to be sought, not in the human mind, but in the conditions of collective life’’ (1997: 27e). If we want to understand the civil laws of a given nature, for example, Montesquieu insists that we must know the size of its population and the nature of the social bonds between its citizens. Montesquieu “is remarkable,’’ Durkheim observed, “for his understanding that the nature of societies is not less fixed and stable than the nature of man, and that it is no easier to change the species of a people than of a living being'' (1997: 28e).

然而，给涂尔干留下更深刻印象的是，孟德斯鸠ーー因此拒绝将民法和政法解释为人性的结果ーー同样拒绝参照最初的协议、合同或公约来解释民法和政法。涂尔干认为，这些契约和约定是人为的，在自然界中没有立足之地，因此颠覆了社会科学的可能性。相比之下，在孟德斯鸠，社会法则“是以一种不同于其他法则的方式建立起来的，这种方式来自于自然，而不是人的本性，而是政治社会的本性。他们的原因是要寻找的，不是在人类的头脑中，而是在集体生活的条件下”(1997:27e)。例如，如果我们想了解某一特定性质的民法，孟德斯鸠坚持认为，我们必须了解其人口规模和公民之间社会纽带的性质。迪尔凯姆观察到，孟德斯鸠“是非凡的，因为他认识到社会的本质并不比人的本质更不固定和稳定，改变一个民族的物种并不比改变一个生命更容易”(1997:28e)。

But Durkheim still understood the extent of Montesquieu's ties to the past. Consider the question raised earlier: If natural law and civil law conflict, how are we to decide which to obey? Confronted with this dilemma, Durkheim realized, Montesquieu insisted that we follow the laws of nature (1949: 59-62). But why, Durkheim asks, should the nature of man be more sacred than the nature of society? The only way out of this impasse, Durkheim argues, is to take a still more extreme position — i.e., to insist that “all legal and moral rules, even those concerning individual life, follow from the nature of society. But on this point as on many others,'' Durkheim observed, “and even in initiating a new approach, Montesquieu is still attached to an older one and held back by it'' (1997: 30e).

但迪尔凯姆仍然明白孟德斯鸠与过去联系的程度。考虑一下之前提出的问题: 如果自然法和民法发生冲突，我们如何决定服从哪一个？面对这个困境，迪尔凯姆意识到，孟德斯鸠坚持我们遵循自然法则(1949:59-62)。但是，涂尔干问道，为什么人的本性要比社会的本性更神圣呢？迪尔凯姆认为，摆脱这种僵局的唯一途径是采取更为极端的立场，即坚持“所有的法律和道德规则，甚至那些关于个人生活的规则，都遵循社会的本质。但在这一点上，正如其他许多人一样,”迪尔凯姆观察到，“甚至在启动一种新的方法时，孟德斯鸠仍然依附于一种旧的方法，并受到它的阻碍”(1997:30e)。

Ostensibly, Montesquieu's treatment of the problem of classification also seemed to have a small foot in the past. Comte had thus emphasized that Montesquieu's classi®cation of societies — i.e., republics (both aristocratic and democratic), monarchies, and despotisms — was really a classi®cation of the ways societies are governed, and that in this sense, Montesquieu had simply adopted the traditional categories of Aristotle. But unlike Comte, who had criticized Montesquieu for this reversion to the Aristotelian classification, Durkheim recognized signi®cant differences between De 1’esprit des lois and the Politics.[75](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark87) The most important of these was that Montesquieu, while naming the types of societies according to their forms of sovereignty, had classified these types according to the nature of their social institutions (1997: 40e±4ie). Where Aristotle had deduced his classi®cation from an abstract, a priori principle (i.e., the number of rulers), therefore, Montesquieu had introduced a more inductive, empiricist approach, comparing real societies (e.g., Rome, Athens, and Sparta) from different regions and historical periods.

从表面上看，孟德斯鸠对待分类问题的态度似乎在过去也有所保留。孔德因此强调，孟德斯鸠的社会分类ーー即共和国(贵族和民主)、君主制和专制ーー实际上是社会治理方式的分类，从这个意义上讲，孟德斯鸠只是采用了亚里士多德的传统分类。但是不同于孔德批评孟德斯鸠这种向亚里士多德分类的倒退，涂尔干认识到《法的精神》和《政治》之间的显著差异。其中最重要的是，孟德斯鸠在根据主权形式命名社会类型的同时，根据社会制度的性质对这些类型进行了分类(1997年: 40e ± 4ie)。亚里士多德从一个抽象的、先验的原则(即统治者的数量)推导出他的分类，因此，孟德斯鸠引入了一个更加归纳的、经验主义的方法，比较不同地区和历史时期的真实社会(如罗马、雅典和斯巴达)。

This introduction of the comparative method explains why, as Momigliano put it, “the link between Montesquieu and Fustel was in everyone's mind'' during the early 1890s (1982: 339). And in De l’esprit des lois, it yielded empirical observations concerning the nature of concrete societies reminiscent of De la division du travail social. In book IV, chapter 5 of De I'esprit des lois, for example, Montesquieu had emphasized the need for the “whole power'' of education in a republic, because this form of government depends upon “arduous and painful'' self-renunciation. This virtue of selfrenunciation, Montesquieu added, “may be defined as the love of the laws and of our country. As such love requires a constant preference of public to private interest, it is the source of all private virtues; for they are nothing more than this very preference itself. The virtues taught in monarchies, by contrast, “are less what we owe to others than to ourselves; they are not so much what draws us towards society, as what distinguishes us from our fellow-citizens'' (1949: 34, 29). The most significant difference between republics and monarchies, Durkheim agreed, is that the former exhibit a kind of political virtue that “lies in love of country, and in which we attach less importance to ourselves and our own concerns than to the state,'' while in the latter, everything has the effect of “turning [citizens] away from common towards private interests, and all the conditions of the virtue which is the basis of a republic are absent'' (1997: 35e, 38e).

这种比照法的引入解释了为什么，正如莫米利亚诺所说，在19世纪90年代早期(1982:339) ，“每个人都认为孟德斯鸠和福斯特尔之间存在联系”。在论法的精神中，它产生了关于具体社会性质的实证观察，让人想起了社会劳动分工。例如，在《法律的精神》第四卷第五章中，孟德斯鸠强调了共和国教育“全权”的必要性，因为这种形式的政府依赖于“艰难而痛苦的”自我放弃。这种自我约束的美德，孟德斯鸠补充道，“可以被定义为对法律和我们国家的热爱。因为这种爱需要公众对私人利益的持续偏好，所以它是所有私人美德的源泉; 因为它们只不过是这种偏好本身。相比之下，君主制教授的美德“与其说是我们欠别人的，不如说是我们欠自己的; 与其说是它们吸引我们走向社会，不如说是它们使我们与同胞区别开来”(1949:34,29)。涂尔干同意，共和制和君主制之间最显著的区别在于，前者展现出一种政治美德，“在于对国家的热爱，在这种美德中，我们对自己和自己关心的事情的重视程度低于对国家的重视”，而在后者中，一切事物都具有“将(公民)从共同利益转向私人利益的效果，而作为共和制基础的美德的所有条件都不存在”(1997:35e，38e)。

More importantly, Montesquieu recognized that this signi®cant difference in the esprit of these societal types could be explained as a necessary consequence of their structural features. The division of labor in a republic, for example, is of a type Durkheim would later call “mechanical”: “The part of each person's consciousness which expresses society and which is the same in everyone is large and powerful, while the part to do only with ourselves and our own individual concerns is small and feeble.'' The division of labor in a monarchy, by contrast, “might be compared with a living being, in which each part has a different function in line with its own nature,'' but in which “their diversity is in fact a source of cohesion'' (1997: 36e, 37e, 38c). And in De l'esprit des lois, Durkheim added, such differences extend to “their whole life. Morals, religion, family, marriage, education, and crime and punishment are not the same in a republic as in despotism or in monarchy.'' In sharp contrast to other writers of the Enlightenment, Montesquieu seems “to have been more interested in the differences between societies than in things that they all have in common'' (1997: 40e).

更重要的是，孟德斯鸠认识到这些社会类型在精神上的巨大差异可以解释为其结构特征的必然结果。例如，共和国的劳动分工就是涂尔干后来称之为“机械”的那种: “每个人意识中表达社会和每个人都一样的那部分是巨大而强大的，而只与我们自己和我们自己的个人关注有关的那部分是微小而脆弱的。”相比之下，君主制的劳动分工“可能被比作一个有生命的存在，其中每个部分都有不同的功能，符合其自身的性质,”但其中“他们的多样性实际上是凝聚力的源泉”(1997年: 36e，37e，38c)。迪尔凯姆补充说，在论法的精神中，这种差异延伸到“他们的整个生活。共和国的道德、宗教、家庭、婚姻、教育、犯罪和惩罚与专制或君主制不同。”与启蒙运动的其他作家形成鲜明对比的是，孟德斯鸠似乎“对社会之间的差异更感兴趣，而不是它们的共同之处”(1997:40e)。

Durkheim thus treated Montesquieu's classi®cation of societal types as a major contribution to the advancement of social science. But its significance paled by comparison with Montesquieu’s application of the concept of law to social phenomena — a judgment that Durkheim derived from his notion of the historical development of the sciences generally. “In every science,’’ Durkheim explained, “the idea of type always appears first, since it is easier for the human mind to conceive of it. It is enough to cast an eye on things to notice certain similarities and differences between them.’’ But the “definite connexions” we call “laws,” he added, “being more closely bound up with the nature of things, lie hidden within this; it is as if a veil is thrown over them, which first has to be taken off to be able to reach and reveal them.’’ How much more difficult, Durkheim then argued, to extend the notion of law to society — “so changeable, so diverse and multiform as not to seem reducible to fixed and definite laws’’ (1997: 72e, 73e).

因此，迪尔凯姆把孟德斯鸠的社会类型分类视为对社会科学进步的重大贡献。但与孟德斯鸠将法律概念应用于社会现象的做法相比，它的意义就相形见绌了ーー迪尔凯姆的这一判断源于他对科学总体历史发展的概念。“在每一门科学中,”涂尔干解释说，“类型的概念总是首先出现，因为人类的头脑更容易想象它。”。只要注意一下事物，就足以发现它们之间的某些相似之处和不同之处。”但是，我们称之为“法律”的“确定的联系”，他补充说，“与事物的本质更紧密地联系在一起，隐藏在这种联系之中; 它就像一层面纱被揭开，必须首先揭开才能触及并揭示它们。”迪尔凯姆接着指出，要把法律的概念扩展到社会中ーー“如此多变、如此多样化和多样化，以至于看起来不能简化为固定和明确的法律”(1997:72e，73e) ，难度要大得多。

To Durkheim, this extension of the idea of law to the realm of social phenomena was Montesquieu’s greatest achievement. “Laws,” Durkheim cited De l’esprit des lois’ famous opening, “are the necessary relations arising from the nature of things. In this sense all beings have their laws: the Deity His laws, the material world its laws, the intelligences superior to man their laws, the beasts their laws, man his laws’’ (1949: 1). This passage epitomized the rationalist belief in a determinate order in nature, subject to the rational interpretation of human beings; and it was Montesquieu’s great distinction to have extended this de®nition from the world of nature to that of society. Comte, of course, had argued that the chaotic mass of empirical data that followed evinced no order whatsoever, insisting that Montesquieu had thus betrayed his Cartesian principles. But here again Durkheim defended Montesquieu’s apostasy, arguing that he was unique among his 18th-century contemporaries in recognizing that the laws inherent within social phenomena are neither ®xed nor immutable; rather, they vary according to the specific conditions of the society in which they are found.

对迪尔凯姆来说，这种将法律理念延伸到社会现象领域的做法是孟德斯鸠最伟大的成就。迪尔凯姆引用了论法的精神著名的开篇: “法律是由事物的本质产生的必要关系。从这个意义上说，所有的生物都有自己的法则: 神的法则，物质世界的法则，智慧高于人类的法则，野兽的法则，人类的法则”(1949:1)。这篇文章集中体现了理性主义者对自然界的一种确定的秩序的信仰，这种秩序受制于对人类的理性解释，而孟德斯鸠将这种定义从自然世界延伸到社会世界，这是它的巨大区别。当然，孔德认为，随之而来的大量混乱的经验数据没有任何规律可言，他坚持认为，孟德斯鸠因此背叛了他的笛卡尔原则。但在这里，涂尔干再次为孟德斯鸠的叛教辩护，认为他在18世纪的同代人中是独一无二的，他认识到社会现象中固有的规律既不是固定不变的，也不是不可改变的，相反，它们根据发现它们的社会的具体条件而变化。

Durkheim’s favorite example here was again one that found a prominent place in De la division du travail social — the influence of social volume on societal types. The republican form of government, for example, is most appropriate to a small population con®ned within a limited geographical setting — since “the conditions of life are almost the same for all’’ and “the very room for diversity is lacking in such a community,’’ social differentiation is rudimentary and all citizens have a sense of their meaningful participation in public affairs. As the society grows larger, “[c]ircumstances are much more diverse, forcing individuals to go different ways and become involved in different things”; thus, it becomes “more difficult for the private citizen to have a sense of the common good,” so that the republic gives way to a monarchy. And if the society grows still larger, the monarchy gives way to despotism, for “it is impossible for a large empire to survive unless its ruler has the absolute power to hold in check many peoples spread over a vast land.”[76](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark88) Again, Durkheim’s admiration for this argument was not unqualified. There are numerous examples of small despotisms and large democracies, for example, and the explanation itself was “uncertain and vague.’’ Most importantly, Montesquieu viewed social volume in largely political terms — i.e., as equivalent to the number of persons subject to the same authority — while for Durkheim, the crucial factor was rather the number of persons bound by the same kind of relationship. But Durkheim still praised Montesquieu’s “intellectual sharpness’’ in attributing such an influence to social volume: “This cause,’’ Durkheim argued, “has the greatest influence in deter mining things in the political world, and indeed we believe it is more or less the source from which the main differences between societies arise’’ (1997: 47e).

涂尔干在这里最喜欢的例子还是一个在社会劳动分工中占有突出地位的例子ーー社会体量对社会类型的影响。例如，共和政体最适合在有限的地理环境下的少数人口ーー因为“所有人的生活条件几乎相同”，“这样的社区缺乏多样性的空间”，社会分化是基本的，所有公民都有意义地参与公共事务。随着社会规模的扩大，“情况变得更加多样化，迫使个人走不同的路，参与不同的事情”; 因此，“私人公民更难有共同利益的意识”，使共和国让位于君主制。如果社会变得更大，君主制就会让位于专制制度，因为“除非统治者有绝对的权力来控制分布在广袤土地上的众多民族，否则一个庞大的帝国是不可能生存下去的。”同样，涂尔干对这一论点的赞赏也不是毫无保留的。例如，小型专制和大型民主国家的例子数不胜数，而解释本身是“不确定和模糊的”最重要的是，孟德斯鸠在很大程度上从政治的角度来看待社会容量，也就是说，社会容量相当于受同一权威约束的人数，而对涂尔干来说，最关键的因素是受同一种关系约束的人数。但是迪尔凯姆仍然称赞孟德斯鸠将这种影响归因于社会容量的“智慧敏锐性”: “这个原因,”迪尔凯姆认为，“在阻止政治世界中的事物发生方面有着最大的影响力，事实上，我们相信它或多或少是社会之间主要差异产生的根源”(1997:47e)。

With factors like social volume exerting such an influence on the development of social institutions, the influence of individual political leaders — and with it that of conscious, willful action generally — would seem to be diminished. But in book XIX, “Of Laws in Relation to the Principles which Form the General Spirit, the Morals, and Customs of a Nation,’’[77](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark89) Montesquieu granted a substantial role to the legislators of China and Sparta in the development of their society’s laws. There were of course limits to this role — e.g., Montesquieu did not believe that laws were made arbitrarily, argued that custom and religion were beyond the power of the legislators, and held that laws relating to other matters had to be compatible with custom and religion. But “the institution of these,’’ Durkheim observed, “is still in the hands of the legislator. Indeed, there are societies in which the ruler is able to shape not just laws but also morals and religion” (1997: 50e).

由于社会容量等因素对社会制度的发展产生了这样的影响，政治领导人个人的影响力ーー以及随之而来的有意识、故意行动的影响力ーー似乎会减弱。但是在第十九卷《法律与形成一个国家的一般精神、道德和习俗的原则》中，孟德斯鸠赋予了中国和斯巴达的立法者在其社会法律发展中的重要作用。这种角色当然有其局限性ーー例如，孟德斯鸠不相信法律是任意制定的，认为习俗和宗教超出了立法者的权力范围，并认为与其他事项有关的法律必须与习俗和宗教相容。但涂尔干说: “这些制度仍然掌握在立法者手中。事实上，在一些社会中，统治者不仅能够塑造法律，还能塑造道德和宗教”(1997:50e)。

To Durkheim, this emphasis on the role of political authority seemed ill ®tted to the more general principle that human laws spring “from the nature of things” (Montesquieu 1949: 1). But this assertion of Montesquieu’s can be interpreted in two different ways. On the one hand, it might mean that human laws follow from the nature of societies as an effect follows from the cause which produces it. In this case, society would be what Aristotle called the efficient cause of the laws in question. On the other hand, it might mean that human laws are simply instruments that the nature of the society requires in order to ful®ll itself. In this case, society would be what Aristotle called the final cause of human laws. Durkheim was convinced that Montesquieu intended the second usage - indeed, that he never even entertained the first. The laws of a democracy, for example, do not result necessarily from the limited number of its citizens “like heat from fire’’; on the contrary, “it is only through [these laws] that there can come about the frugalness and general equality which lie in the nature of this society’’ (1997: 51e). From the view that society is thus a ®nal rather than an ef®cient cause, it follows that laws cannot be formed arbitrarily; for under any particular set of social conditions, only one body of laws would be appropriate. From the same view, it follows that what laws are suitable to a particular society can be determined only by those who have some insight into its peculiar nature, a consequence that grants - as does Montesquieu - a considerable role to political authority.

在涂尔干看来，这种对政治权威作用的强调似乎与更为普遍的原则——人类法律源于“事物的本质”——格格不入(孟德斯鸠1949:1)。但是，对于孟德斯鸠的这一主张，可以有两种不同的解读。一方面，它可能意味着人类法律遵循社会的本质，正如影响遵循产生它的原因一样。在这种情况下，社会就是亚里士多德所说的有关法律的有效原因。另一方面，它可能意味着人类法律只是社会的本质需要的工具，以充分自我。在这种情况下，社会就是亚里士多德所说的人类法律的最终原因。迪尔凯姆确信，孟德斯鸠打算使用第二种用法——实际上，他甚至从未考虑过第一种用法。例如，一个民主国家的法律，并不一定是因为它的公民数量有限而产生的，相反，“只有通过[这些法律] ，才能实现这个社会本质上的节俭和普遍平等”(1997:51e)。从社会是一个自然而非根本原因的观点来看，法律不能任意形成，因为在任何特定的社会条件下，只有一套法律才是适当的。从同样的观点来看，什么样的法律适合某个特定的社会，只能由那些对其特殊性有一些洞察力的人来决定，这一结果赋予了政治权威(孟德斯鸠也是如此)相当大的作用。

Much of the explanatory power of De la division du travail social, of course, derives precisely from Durkheim’s view that social causes are efficient (not final) causes — indeed, that legal institutions follow social forces almost “like heat from fire.’’ The same arguments are foreshadowed in the Latin thesis. Social institutions, Durkheim argued,

当然，《社会劳动分工》中的许多解释力恰恰源于迪尔凯姆的观点，即社会原因是有效的(而非最终的)原因ーー事实上，法律制度遵循社会力量，几乎“就像来自火中的热量”同样的论点也在拉丁文论文中得到了预示。迪尔凯姆认为，社会制度,

do not usually become established according to a plan, and laws are not devices a legislator invents because they seem in line with the nature of a society. They are most often the result of causes that produce them with something like a physical necessity. Collective life is so shaped by a people’s circumstances that it must take on a particular de®nite form. The laws express this form. They therefore follow from the same efficient causes with the same necessity.

法律不是立法者发明的工具，因为它们看起来符合社会的本质。它们通常是原因的结果，这些原因产生了它们，就像生理上的必需品一样。集体生活是由一个民族的环境所决定的，因此必须采取某种特定的形式。法律规定了这种形式。因此，它们出于同样有效的原因，具有同样的必要性。

It is at least arguable that Durkheim’s differences with Montesquieu here derive largely from Durkheim’s exposure to the German social science, and particularly the historical school of jurisprudence. “Montesquieu,” Durkheim argued, “would undoubtedly have realized this if he had seen that laws are not so different in nature from morals, but, on the contrary, emanate from them’’ (1997: 52e). However useful laws may be to a society, this refers to their functions, not their causes; and the latter lie in the collective unconscious of earlier generations, far beyond the rational will of legislators.

迪尔凯姆与孟德斯鸠之间的差异主要源于他对德国社会科学，尤其是历史法学流派的接触，这一点至少是有争议的。“孟德斯鸠,”迪尔凯姆争辩道，“如果他看到法律在本质上与道德并没有那么大的不同，相反，它们是从法律中产生出来的，毫无疑问，他会意识到这一点。”(1997:52e)。无论法律对社会有多大用处，都是指法律的功能，而非法律产生的原因，而后者是前几代人的集体潜意识，远远超出立法者的理性意愿。

Quite aside from his Aristotelian predilection for final causes, Montesquieu’s conception of the laws governing social phenomena had at least two other implications that troubled Durkheim. First, Montesquieu’s position that civil laws do not follow necessarily from efficient causes introduced an element of contingency in the relationship between natural and positive laws, sometimes reflected in the blunders of human, and therefore entirely fallible, legislators. But the fortuitous blunders to which Montesquieu referred were, to Durkheim, simply those “diseases” of the social organism that play such an important role in book 3 of De la division du travail social; and disease, Durkheim extended the metaphor, no less than health, is inherent in the nature of living things (1984: 291—341). Moreover, because both health and disease are thus parts of the same determinate order, they can be compared in a manner that advances our understanding of each. In short, like Montesquieu, Durkheim employed the classical, metaphorical language of medicine; but he used it for a different purpose — i.e., to eliminate the element of contingency from positive laws, and thus to assimilate them within his own, more mechanistic philosophy of science.

除了亚里士多德对终极原因的偏爱，孟德斯鸠对社会现象的规律的概念至少还有两个其他的含义困扰着涂尔干。首先，孟德斯鸠认为民法不一定遵循有效的原因，这种立场在自然法和实在法之间的关系中引入了一种偶然因素，有时反映在人类立法者的错误中，因此完全可能出错。但是对于迪尔凯姆来说，孟德斯鸠提到的偶然性错误只是社会有机体的“疾病”，它们在《社会劳动分工》第三卷中扮演着重要角色; 而疾病，迪尔凯姆扩展了这个比喻，不亚于健康，是生物本性所固有的(1984:291ー341)。此外，因为健康和疾病都是同一确定顺序的组成部分，所以可以通过促进我们对每一个的理解的方式进行比较。简而言之，像孟德斯鸠一样，迪尔凯姆使用了经典的、隐喻性的医学语言，但是他用它来达到不同的目的ーー即，消除实在法中的偶然因素，从而将它们吸收到他自己的、更机械化的科学哲学中。

Second, while Montesquieu had insisted that laws are “the necessary relations arising from the nature of things,’’ his parallel insistence that such laws might be violated indicated that this “necessity” was not real but merely logical. The laws might “necessarily’’ express what is implied in the de®nition of a society, Durkheim observed, while the de®nition itself might not follow rationally from the nature of the society in question. In this case, the laws would tell us what is rational rather than what is real. So here again, Durkheim sided with the realism of German social science against the Cartesian rationalist. Montesquieu, Durkheim thus complained, applies the word “laws” to relations between ideas rather than the relations between things. Durkheim was perplexed, for example, by Montesquieu’s suggestion that certain institutions (e.g., slavery) were incompatible with the “nature” of certain kinds of societies (e.g., republics), despite the fact that all ancient republics had slavery. By such a view, Durkheim objected, “the order to be investigated in such terms by science is not only not something which exists everywhere and at all times, but it might even turn out that it has never existed.’’ So Durkheim clearly suspected Montesquieu of occasionally reverting to an older, rationalist and idealist conception of social science, one concerned with things “not as they are, but as they ought to be’’ (1997: 58e).

其次，尽管孟德斯鸠坚持认为法律是“由事物本质产生的必然关系”，但他同时坚持认为这种法律可能被违反，这表明这种“必然性”并非真实存在，而仅仅是逻辑上的。涂尔干注意到，法律可能“必然”表达了社会定义中所隐含的内容，而定义本身可能不会理性地遵循有关社会的性质。在这种情况下，法律会告诉我们什么是合理的，而不是什么是真实的。因此，在这里，涂尔干再次站在德国社会科学的现实主义一边，反对笛卡尔的理性主义。迪尔凯姆因此抱怨说，孟德斯鸠将“法律”这个词应用于思想之间的关系，而不是事物之间的关系。例如，孟德斯鸠认为某些制度(如奴隶制)与某些类型社会(如共和国)的“本质”不相容，尽管事实上所有古代共和国都有奴隶制，涂尔干对此感到困惑。根据这种观点，迪尔凯姆反对，“科学用这种术语来研究的秩序不仅不是随时随地都存在的东西，而且它甚至可能被证明从未存在过。”因此，迪尔凯姆明确怀疑孟德斯鸠有时会回归到一种更为古老、理性主义和唯心主义的社会科学概念，一种关注事物“不是它们本来的样子，而是它们应该是什么样子”的概念(1997:58e)。

“As long as politics consisted in art,’’ Durkheim continued, “political writers mainly made use of deduction. They derived, from a universal idea of man, the form of society which suited human nature and the rules which ought to be observed in common life.’’ To Durkheim — recently exposed to the achievements of Wundt and his associates at the Physiologische Institut in Leipzig — the French adherence to this Cartesian tradition was the greatest obstacle to a scientific sociology and, indirectly, to a secular morality for the Third Republic. Durkheim acknowledged that deduction “comes to our help with ideas that steer research through the obscurity of things’’; but where we are dealing with “realities” rather than with “abstract concepts,’’ these ideas must be confirmed by observation and, still more importantly, by experiment. In fact, it is not enough just to observe nature, Durkheim argued: “it is necessary to go beyond this and interrogate it, turn it over and over and put it through every kind of test.’’ Because social science “deals with things, only the experimental method can succeed in it’’ (1997: 59e).

“只要政治存在于艺术之中,”涂尔干继续说道，“政治作家就主要使用演绎法。它们来源于人的普遍观念，适合人性的社会形态，以及在日常生活中应该遵守的规则。”涂尔干最近在莱比锡的生理学研究所接触了冯特和他的同事们的成就。对涂尔干来说，法国人对笛卡尔传统的坚持是科学社会学的最大障碍，也间接地阻碍了第三共和国的世俗道德。迪尔凯姆承认，演绎法“有助于我们的观点，引导研究通过事物的模糊性”; 但是，当我们处理的是“现实”而不是“抽象概念”，这些观点必须通过观察来证实，更重要的是，通过实验。事实上，仅仅观察自然是不够的，涂尔干认为: “有必要超越自然，审问自然，反复研究自然，并对自然进行各种测试。”因为社会科学“处理事物，只有实验方法才能成功”(1997:59e)。

Durkheim’s model here, as we have already seen, was Wundt’s experimental psychology laboratory in Leipzig; but as we have also seen, Durkheim shared Comte’s view that experimentation was impossible in the study of human societies. In short, Durkheim needed a substitute for the experimental method, one more appropriate to the nature of the subject matter under investigation, but which retained the “precision,’’ “detail,’’ and “control’’ of its psychological counterpart. He found this substitute in the comparative method. The “whole point of experiment,’’ Durkheim observed, consists simply “in varying things more or less at will,’’ so that they provide “a rich, extensive basis for comparison.’’ In the same way, we can “[compare] social facts of the same kind, as they occur in different societies,’’ identifying “which of them exist together everywhere, disappear simultaneously or change at the same time and according to the same pattern.'' To discover the laws of nature, therefore, we need only to “establish a sufficient number of comparisons between different forms of the same thing.'' This enables us to distinguish the “fixed, constant connexions which express a law'' from “the chance and the transient.'' In social science, Durkheim concluded, comparison can take the place of experiment (1997: 6oe).

我们已经看到，涂尔干的模型是冯特在莱比锡的实验心理学实验室; 但是我们也看到，涂尔干赞同孔德的观点，即实验在人类社会的研究中是不可能的。简而言之，迪尔凯姆需要一种替代实验方法，一种更适合被研究对象性质的方法，但它保留了心理学对应物的“精确性”、“细节”和“控制”。他在比照法里找到了这个替代品。涂尔干观察到，“实验的整体观点”仅仅包括“随心所欲地改变事物”，因此它们提供了“一个丰富而广泛的比较基础”同样，我们可以“比较同类的社会事实，因为它们发生在不同的社会中”，确定“其中哪些事实在任何地方都同时存在，同时消失，或者在同一时间按照同样的模式发生变化。”因此，要发现自然法则，我们只需要“在同一事物的不同形式之间建立足够数量的比较”这使我们能够区分“表达法则的固定的、不变的联系”和“偶然的和短暂的”涂尔干总结说，在社会科学中，比较可以取代实验(1997:6oe)。

Montesquieu, Durkheim then argued, instinctively realized the need for this comparative method. Montesquieu's purpose in gathering data from various cultures and throughout history was precisely to compare them and derive laws from them; indeed, Durkheim added, “the entire work consists in a comparison of the laws observed by the most diverse peoples and it can be truly said that he inaugurated, with his book, the new discipline nowadays called comparative law'' (1997: 6oe). But Durkheim still found Montesquieu's social science too much in the Cartesian tradition. “I have laid down the first principles,'' Montesquieu had announced, for example, “and have found that the particular cases follow naturally from them; that the histories of all nations are only consequences of them; and that every particular law is connected with another law, or depends on some other of a more general extent'' (1949: lxvii). Quite reasonably, Durkheim took this as a declaration that Montesquieu intended “to treat politics in an almost mathematical manner,'' laying down ®rst principles “from which the particular laws of societies follow logically'' (1997: 6oe±61e). Far from collecting all the relevant facts and studying them objectively, Montesquieu thus “starts with a proof, by pure deduction, of what it is he has in mind'' (1997: 61e). Where he claims that there is a causal relation between two facts, for example, Montesquieu rarely shows that they appear simultaneously, disappear simultaneously, or vary in the same way. Again, an entire societal type (e.g., monarchy) is sometimes endowed with a specific property (e.g., the separation of powers) that he has observed in only a single case (e.g., England). And again, he insists that certain institutions (e.g., slavery) cannot be appropriate to certain societies (e.g., Athens) because they cannot be derived from the principles of these societies (e.g., virtue) as he conceives them. “If, then, induction makes its ®rst appearance in political science with Montesquieu,'' Durkheim concluded, “it has still not broken away from the opposite method and is corrupted by the connexion'' (1997: 63c).

迪尔凯姆接着辩称，孟德斯鸠本能地意识到这种比照法的必要性。孟德斯鸠收集来自不同文化和整个历史的数据的目的正是为了比较它们并从中得出规律，事实上，迪尔凯姆补充说，“整个工作包括对最多样化的民族所遵循的规律进行比较，可以说，他用他的书开创了当今称为比较法的新学科”(1997:6oe)。但是迪尔凯姆仍然认为孟德斯鸠的社会科学太过于笛卡尔的传统。例如，孟德斯鸠已经宣布: “我已经制定了第一条原则，并且发现特定的案例自然而然地遵循这些原则，所有国家的历史只是它们的结果，每一条特定的法律都与另一条法律相关联，或者取决于其他更广泛的范围”(1949: lxvii)。迪尔凯姆理所当然地认为，这是一种宣言，孟德斯鸠打算“以近乎数学的方式对待政治”，制定了第一原则，“社会的特定规律从中得到逻辑遵循”(1997年: 6oe ± 61e)。孟德斯鸠非但没有收集所有相关的事实并客观地研究它们，反而“从纯粹的演绎证明开始，证明他所想的是什么”(1997:61e)。例如，在他声称两个事实之间存在因果关系的地方，孟德斯鸠很少表明它们同时出现、同时消失或以同样的方式变化。同样，一个完整的社会类型(例如君主制)有时被赋予一个特定的属性(例如权力分立) ，他只在一个案例中观察到(例如英格兰)。同样，他坚持认为，某些制度(如奴隶制)不适合某些社会(如雅典) ，因为它们不能从这些社会的原则(如美德) ，因为他设想他们。迪尔凯姆总结道: “如果归纳法第一次出现在孟德斯鸠的政治科学中，它仍然没有脱离相反的方法，并且被联系所腐蚀。”。

This “ambiguity in method” of De 1’esprit des lois, Durkheim observed, had at least two causes. The ®rst was Montesquieu’s inability to break with the powerful tradition of Cartesian rationalism, according to which the “normal” institutional arrangements of any society are implicit within the underlying “nature” of that society. These arrangements could therefore be logically deduced once the nature of the society in question has been de®ned; and it was these logical necessities that Montesquieu called laws. The startling thing to a more skeptical, empiricist age, Durkheim hinted, was the ease with which Montesquieu felt this underlying nature could be grasped; but this was utterly consistent with Montesquieu’s rationalist principles: “Just as the connexion which exists between political facts and a society’s essence is rational,’’ Durkheim explained, “so this essence - the source of the entire deduction - has the same nature, consisting in a simple notion reason can quickly get hold of.’’ Montesquieu thus failed to grasp the extent to which, as Francis Bacon argued in the Novum Organum, the “subtlety of things’ far surpasses the “subtlety of the human mind’ (Durkheim 1997: 63c). If “a certain logic lies hidden in [social phenomena],’’ Durkheim admitted, “it is different from the one we use in deductive reasoning; it does not have the same simplicity; perhaps it even follows other laws.’’ Thus, Durkheim added, “we need to ®nd out about it from things themselves” (1997: 640). The second cause was, in a sense, the inverse of the ®rst. However rational the laws of nature, we have already seen that Montesquieu admitted the possibility - even the empirical frequency - of their being violated and corrupted by human legislators. This possibility admitted, it becomes impossible to discover the “normal” institutional arrangements of any society by inductive means. The result, Durkheim argues, is that Montesquieu always felt the typical rationalist's distrust of the powers of empirical observation and — his “instinctive recognition’’ of its necessity notwithstanding — of comparison as well (1997: 64e).

迪尔凯姆观察到，《法律的精神》中的这种“方法上的歧义”至少有两个原因。首先是孟德斯鸠无法打破笛卡尔理性主义的强大传统，根据笛卡尔理性主义，任何社会的“正常”制度安排都隐含在该社会的潜在“本质”之中。因此，一旦这个社会的性质得到确定，这些安排就可以合乎逻辑地推断出来，孟德斯鸠称之为法律的正是这些合乎逻辑的必需品。迪尔凯姆暗示，对于一个更加怀疑、更加经验主义的时代来说，令人吃惊的是，孟德斯鸠感到这种潜在的本质可以被轻易地抓住，但这完全符合孟德斯鸠的理性主义原则: “正如存在于政治事实和社会本质之间的联系是理性的,”迪尔凯姆解释说，“所以这种本质——整个演绎的来源——具有相同的本质，包含一个简单的概念，理性可以很快抓住。”正如弗朗西斯•培根(Francis Bacon)在《新奥尔加姆》(Novum Organum)一书中所言，孟德斯鸠因此未能理解“事物的微妙之处”远远超过“人类思维的微妙之处”(迪尔凯姆1997:63c)。迪尔凯姆承认，如果“某种逻辑隐藏在[社会现象]之中,”“它不同于我们在演绎推理中使用的逻辑，它没有同样的简单性，也许它甚至遵循其他的规律。”因此，涂尔干补充说，“我们需要从事物本身中找出它”(1997:640)。在某种意义上，第二个原因与第一个原因相反。无论自然法则多么理性，我们已经看到，孟德斯鸠承认了它们被人类立法者违反和腐化的可能性——甚至是经验上的频率。承认这种可能性，就不可能通过归纳的方法发现任何社会的“正常”制度安排。涂尔干认为，其结果是，孟德斯鸠总是感受到典型的理性主义者对经验观察的力量的不信任，而且——尽管他“本能地认识到”这种力量的必要性——对比较也是如此(1997:64e)。

Proceeding deductively or inductively, however, Montesquieu had recognized a related, equally important principle of the comparative method — i.e., that all the elements of a society (e.g., religion, law, morality, the economy, etc.) form an organic whole. “Unless there is investigation into the ways in which they harmonize and are affected by one another,’’ Durkheim argued, “the function that each has cannot be determined. Indeed, their nature will remain completely hidden. They will be seen as so many separately existing realities, when they are merely parts of a reality” (1997: 65e—66e). And the previous failure to adhere to this principle had been severely damaging not only to social science but also — if we read carefully between the lines of Durkheim’s examples — to political and economic reform. Moral philosophers, for example, had dealt with questions of ethics “As if these exist on their own,’’ and were “uninterested in the nature of wealth in the societies concerned.’’ Inversely, political economists had dealt with the subject of wealth “not taking any notice of the body of rules that constitutes ethics’’ (1997: 65c). In the strict sense, Durkheim argued, social science did not exist “until it at last became clear that these particular sciences are linked together by a strict necessity and are parts of a whole’’; and “in showing such interrelationships, Montesquieu looked ahead to the unity of our science, although in a vague and confused way’’ (1997: 66e).

然而，通过演绎或归纳，孟德斯鸠已经认识到一个相关的、同等重要的比照法原则，即一个社会的所有要素(如宗教、法律、道德、经济等)构成一个有机的整体。迪尔凯姆认为: “除非对它们协调和相互影响的方式进行调查，否则它们各自具有的功能是无法确定的。”。事实上，他们的本性将被完全隐藏。当它们仅仅是现实的一部分时，它们将被视为许多独立存在的现实”(1997:65e ー66e)。此前未能坚持这一原则，不仅严重损害了社会科学，而且严重损害了政治和经济改革(如果我们仔细阅读迪尔凯姆的例子的字里行间)。例如，道德哲学家曾经处理过道德问题，“就好像这些问题是独立存在的一样”，而且“对相关社会中财富的本质不感兴趣”相反地，政治经济学家处理了财富这一主题，“没有注意到构成道德的一系列规则”(1997:65c)。在严格意义上，迪尔凯姆认为，社会科学并不存在，“直到它最终变得清楚，这些特定的科学是由一个严格的必要性联系在一起，是一个整体的一部分”，和“在展示这种相互关系，孟德斯鸠期待我们的科学的统一，虽然在一个模糊和混乱的方式”(1997:66e)。

Finally, any discussion of the sources of Durkheim’s comparative method must pay special attention to the powerful evolutionary perspective articulated in De la division du travail social. When we compare different societies, Durkheim observed, we notice that “certain forms or properties’’ that are “clearly tied up’’ in some societies are “hardly developed’’ in others, an observation that leads us to speak of some societies as “superior,’’ and to suggest that these grow out of their “inferior’’ counterparts. Here Durkheim explicitly rejected unilinear evolutionary doctrines that placed ancient societies at the bottom and modern societies at the top. This caveat entered, however, Durkheim endorsed the notion that “societies arise out of one another’’ and that “the more recent overtake and surpass those that came earlier’’ as one that has transformed the method of social science (1997: 670). Montesquieu was not completely oblivious to this notion, Durkheim acknowledged, in the sense that he preferred “the republic and monarchy to despotism, monarchy to the republic, and the republic to primitive democracy.’’ But he did not understand that these different societal types “descended from the same root,’’ and argued instead that “each formed separately from the others’’ (1997: 68e). Discussing particular peoples, while Montesquieu did not deny that “their social principle can grow or be corrupted,’’ therefore, he did believe that “this is hxed and dehnite from the very beginning and must remain intact throughout their entire history.’’ The result is that Montesquieu failed to see that “the nature of societies contains opposites,’’ the consequence of its having emerged from a past but not yet realized its future; in short, Montesquieu did not understand that process “in which society, while always keeping to its own nature, forever embarks on an ascent of something new'' (1997: 68e±69e). In effect, Durkheim was arguing that Montesquieu shared one of the more salient shortcomings of the Enlightenment mentality in general ± i.e., an acute lack of historical sensibilities.

最后，任何关于迪尔凯姆比照法来源的讨论，都必须特别注意《社会劳动分工》中阐述的强有力的进化论观点。当我们比较不同的社会时，涂尔干观察到，我们注意到“某些形式或属性”在一些社会中“明显捆绑”，在另一些社会中“几乎没有发展”，这一观察导致我们说一些社会是“优越的”，并建议这些发展出他们的“劣等”对应物。在这一点上，涂尔干明确反对将古代社会置于底层，而将现代社会置于顶层的单线性进化学说。然而，这个警告进入，涂尔干赞同的概念，“社会彼此产生”和“更近期的超越和超越那些来得更早”，作为一个已经改变了社会科学的方法(1997:670)。迪尔凯姆承认，孟德斯鸠并非完全无视这个概念，在某种意义上，他更喜欢“共和国和君主制而非专制，君主制而非共和制，共和国而非原始民主制。”但是他并不理解这些不同的社会类型“起源于同一个根源”，相反，他认为“每个社会类型都是独立于其他社会类型而形成的”(1997:68e)。在谈到特定的民族时，孟德斯鸠并不否认“他们的社会原则可以成长，也可以被腐化”，因此，他确实相信“这种原则从一开始就是有害的，必须在他们的整个历史中保持不变。”其结果是，孟德斯鸠没有看到“社会的本质包含对立面”，这是它从过去出现但尚未实现其未来的结果，简而言之，孟德斯鸠不理解这一过程，“在这一过程中，社会始终保持自己的本性，永远开始一些新的东西”(1997年: 68e ± 69e)。实际上，迪尔凯姆认为，孟德斯鸠与启蒙运动心态一样，普遍存在一个更为突出的缺陷，即严重缺乏对历史的敏感性。

This was a shortcoming that Durkheim ± having taken the full measure of the German historical school of jurisprudence ± did not share. Social existence, he argued, is determined by causes of two distinct types. The ®rst consists of present circumstances, including the society's topography and population size ± matters to which Montesquieu granted considerable attention. The second type concerns causes that are more historical: “Just as any child would be different with different parents,'' Durkheim explained, “a society varies according to the form of preceding societies.'' Failing to see the “succession and connectedness of societies,'' Durkheim observed, Montesquieu almost completely ignored causes of this second type. The result was that Montesquieu's comparative method contrasted sharply with that of Comte, who argued that “the nature of societies is totally dependent on the moment of time at which they made their appearance,” and also that social science consists “in establishing the evolutionary sequence of societies.'' But each of these approaches, Durkheim concluded, “expresses only one side of the truth'' (1997: 6ge).

这是迪尔凯姆在充分考虑德国历史法学流派的基础上没有提出的一个缺点。他认为，社会存在是由两种不同类型的原因决定的。第一部分包括目前的情况，包括孟德斯鸠特别关注的社会地形和人口规模 ± 问题。第二种类型涉及更具历史性的原因: “正如任何孩子在父母不同的情况下都会有所不同一样,”迪尔凯姆解释说，“一个社会根据先前社会的形式而变化。”迪尔凯姆观察到，由于没有看到“社会的继承和联系”，孟德斯鸠几乎完全忽视了第二种类型的原因。其结果是，孟德斯鸠的比照法与孔德的形成了鲜明对比。孔德认为，“社会的性质完全取决于它们出现的时间”，而且社会科学包括“建立社会的进化顺序”但是涂尔干总结说，这些方法中的每一种“只表达了真理的一面”(1997:6ge)。

In sum, virtually every aspect of Durkheim's Latin thesis on Montesquieu reflects his ambivalence concerning the legacy of Cartesian metaphysics, as well as his growing attraction for the normative vocabulary of German social science. Durkheim admired Montesquieu's recognition of the real, concrete diversity of societal types, praised his refusal to deduce “rules valid for all peoples'' from artificial first principles, and ± anticipating De la division du travail social ± applauded his explanation of the esprit of each societal type as the natural consequence of its structural features. At least equal praise was given to Montesquieu's refusal ± so unusual among his Enlightenment contemporaries ± to reduce explanations of civil and political law to the principles of human nature, or to some putative, original contract or covenant. Durkheim lamented the extent to which Montesquieu was still bound by the legacy of Aristotle and by the traditions of natural law, not to mention the disturbing element of contingency which leavened the causal explanations of De l'esprit des lois. But, recognizing that Montesquieu’s “greatest achievement” — i.e., the extension of the idea of law to the realm of social phenomena — reflected an undeniable, continuing attachment to the rationalist belief in a determinate order of nature, Durkheim still emphasized how “unique” it was for an 18th-century social philosopher to insist that these laws were neither fixed nor immutable. Finally, the notion that “social volume’’ affects the structures of law and society, which plays so large a role in De la division du travail social, was found in Montesquieu’s discussion of the conditions of republican government.

总而言之，迪尔凯姆关于孟德斯鸠的拉丁文论文的几乎每一个方面都反映了他对笛卡尔形而上学遗产的矛盾心理，以及他对德国社会科学规范词汇的日益增长的吸引力。迪尔凯姆赞赏孟德斯鸠对社会类型真正具体多样性的认识，赞扬他拒绝从人为的第一原则中推断出“对所有人有效的规则”，并且 ± 预期社会劳动分工 ± 赞扬他对每种社会类型的精神作为其结构特征的自然结果的解释。对于孟德斯鸠拒绝将民法和政法的解释减少到人性的原则，或者某些公认的原始契约或契约，他的启蒙运动时代的人们给予了至少同样的赞扬。迪尔凯姆哀叹孟德斯鸠仍然受到亚里士多德遗产和自然法传统的约束，更不用说令人不安的偶然性因素，它使论法的精神的因果解释发生了变化。但是，认识到孟德斯鸠的“最伟大的成就”ーー即将法律的概念扩展到社会现象的领域ーー反映了一种不可否认的、持续的对自然界确定秩序的理性主义信仰的依恋，迪尔凯姆仍然强调，对于一个18世纪的社会哲学家来说，坚持这些法律既不是固定的也不是不可改变的是多么“独特”。最后，“社会容量”影响法律和社会结构的概念，在社会劳动分工中扮演如此重要的角色，在孟德斯鸠对共和政府条件的讨论中找到了。

This ambivalence in Durkheim’s treatment of De l'esprit des lois was more than matched by that work itself. For, as Berlin has shown, Montesquieu was a most reluctant rationalist, an uneasy ally amidst the Enlightenment’s celebration of reason, reform, and social progress, and an author whose greatest achievements derived precisely from those moments when, seduced by an insatiable curiosity and a fascination for the particular, the detailed, and the concrete, he digressed and thus deserted the rationalist credo of his milieu. In fact, it was precisely this reluctance and uneasiness, these digressions and this eventual apostasy, that excited Durkheim’s interest. For Durkheim shared this ambivalence, sensed it in his predecessor, and thus used the Latin thesis as a vehicle for the “working out’’ of his own conception of the relative value of rationalism and empiricism.

迪尔凯姆对待论法的精神的这种矛盾心理与他的作品本身是完全一致的。因为，正如柏林所表明的，孟德斯鸠是一个最不情愿的理性主义者，一个在启蒙运动对理性、改革和社会进步的庆祝中不安的盟友，一个作家最伟大的成就恰恰来自于那些时刻，受到永不满足的好奇心和对特定的、详细的和具体的迷恋的诱惑，他偏离并因此抛弃了他所处环境中的理性主义信条。事实上，正是这种不情愿和不安，这些离题和最终的背叛，激发了涂尔干的兴趣。因为涂尔干分享了这种矛盾心理，在他的前任身上感受到了这种心理，因此他将拉丁文命题作为一种工具，用来“制定”他自己的理性主义和经验主义相对价值的概念。

THE NATURE OF SOCIAL THINGS

社会事物的本质

In the development of Durkheim’s social realism, the emphasis of the works we’ve discussed thus far — i.e., Durkheim’s early reviews and essays (1885—90), the Latin thesis (1892), and De la division du travail social (1893) — was on the notion of society as a part of nature. Indeed, even in the more spiritualist context of the Sens lectures, Durkheim had insisted that altruistic sentiments are as “natural” as their egoistic counterparts. As long as Durkheim was thus concerned to emphasize that societies were natural entities, subject to the laws of nature, writers like Hobbes and Rousseau, with their emphasis on a “social contract’’ and the related implication that social institutions were works of “art,” were anathema; indeed, these early essays and theses are filled with critical remarks about both Le Contrat social and Emile. Almost immediately after the publication of De la division du travail social, however, Durkheim seems to have increasingly focused more on the notion that society is a particular part of nature, that sociological explanations are irreducible to their psychological counterparts, and that social “things” have distinctive characteristics (e.g., externality and constraint). As this emphasis changed, and as Durkheim became increasingly embroiled in L'Affaire Dreyfus, he returned to Rousseau, where he found a rich, complex, and powerful vocabulary upon which he drew in his theory of anomic suicide. This re-reading of Rousseau will be dealt with below; but first, it is necessary to explain why Durkheim’s interests and emphasis might have changed in this way. One plausible answer is that, by 1894, he was locked in a contest with Jean-Gabriel Tarde (1843—1904) — the most formidable intellectual opponent he would face in his career.

在迪尔凯姆社会现实主义的发展过程中，我们到目前为止讨论的作品，即迪尔凯姆的早期评论和散文(1885-90)、拉丁文论文(1892)和社会劳动分工(1893)的重点是社会作为自然的一部分的概念。事实上，即使是在森斯讲座更加精神主义的背景下，涂尔干也坚持认为，利他主义的情感和利己主义的情感一样是“自然的”。只要涂尔干这样强调社会是自然实体，服从自然法则，像霍布斯和卢梭这样强调“社会契约”和相关暗示社会制度是“艺术”的作品的作家就会遭人唾弃; 事实上，这些早期的文章和论文充满了对《社会契约论》和《埃米尔》的批判性评论。然而，几乎在《社会劳动分工》出版后不久，涂尔干似乎越来越关注社会是自然的一个特定部分的观念，社会学的解释是不可还原的，它们的心理学对应物，社会“事物”具有独特的特征(例如，外部性和约束)。随着这种强调的改变，以及迪尔凯姆越来越多地卷入《 L’affaire Dreyfus 》 ，他回到了卢梭，在那里，他发现了丰富、复杂和强大的词汇，他在他的无名自杀理论中借鉴了这些词汇。这种对卢梭的重新解读将在下面讨论; 但是首先，有必要解释为什么涂尔干的兴趣和重点可能会以这种方式发生变化。一个可信的答案是，到1894年，他与让-加布里埃尔•塔德(Jean-Gabriel Tarde，1843-1904)陷入了一场较量。塔德是他职业生涯中遇到的最强大的知识分子对手。

Tarde was born in Sarlat, a small town about one hundred miles from Bordeaux. Rigorously trained in Latin, Greek, history, and mathematics at the local Jesuit school, Tarde developed a strong respect for the role of the intellect in social progress, an appreciation of the manner in which a classical education bound together the leaders of France, and a preference for a hierarchical conception of society. Fascinated by mathematics, he considered entering the Ecole Polytechnique, but an eye disease forced him to limit his reading, and he eventually settled on the study of law. After passing his initial examinations at the nearby Toulouse Faculty of Law, he completed his legal studies in Paris in 1865. Between 1869 and 1894, Tarde accepted a series of regional positions in and around Sarlat, which gave him time to read the works of Hegel, Spencer, Mill, and especially Cournot, whose L'enchainement des idees fondamentales dans les sciences et l'histoire (1861) inspired his ideas about imitation.

塔德出生在 Sarlat，一个距离波尔多一百英里的小镇。在当地的耶稣会学校接受了严格的拉丁语、希腊语、历史和数学训练，塔尔德对知识分子在社会进步中的作用产生了强烈的尊重，欣赏古典教育将法国领导人联系在一起的方式，并偏爱社会的等级观念。由于对数学着迷，他考虑进入巴黎综合理工学院，但眼疾迫使他限制阅读，最终他决定学习法律。在附近的图卢兹法学院通过初步考试后，他于1865年在巴黎完成了法律学业。1869年至1894年间，塔尔德在 Sarlat 及其周边地区接受了一系列地区性的职位，这使他有时间阅读黑格尔、斯宾塞、密尔的著作，尤其是古诺的作品，他的《科学与历史中基本思想的链接》(1861)启发了他关于模仿的思想。

By the age of thirty, Tarde had drafted a series of notes that contained many of the essentials of his later theoretical works. But Tarde’s legal work also stimulated an interest in criminology; and this, in turn, led him to read the works of Lombroso, Garofalo, Ferri, and others. This “new Italian school’’ had enjoyed some success explaining crime as the consequence of racial and geographical causes. Against the Italians, Tarde had soon published a series of critical articles — eventually collected for his first book, La criminalite comparee (1886) — which emphasized the role of socialization and imitation as causes of crime, and established him as the leading spokesman for what was later called the “French school’’ of criminology. A frequent contributor to the Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle, Tarde became the journal’s co-director in 1893; but his last major work in criminology was La philosophie penale (1890), as his interests had already turned in the direction of sociology.

三十岁时，塔尔德起草了一系列笔记，其中包含了他后期理论著作的许多要点。但是塔尔德的法律工作也激发了人们对犯罪学的兴趣，这反过来又促使他阅读了隆布罗索、加罗法洛、费里等人的著作。这个“新意大利学派”在解释犯罪是种族和地理原因造成的后果方面取得了一些成功。针对意大利人，塔尔德很快发表了一系列批评性的文章，最终收集起来写成了他的第一本书《犯罪比较》(1886) ，强调了社会化和模仿作为犯罪原因的作用，并确立了他作为后来被称为“法国学派”的犯罪学的主要代言人的地位。作为《刑事人类学档案》的经常撰稿人，塔德在1893年成为该杂志的联合主任; 但他在犯罪学方面的最后一项主要工作是《刑罚哲学》(1890年) ，因为他的兴趣已经转向了社会学的方向。

Throughout the 1880s, Tarde had published a series of articles in the Revue philosophique which Steven Lukes has characterized as “a one-man campaign against the various forms of biologism in sociology — Darwinism, organicism, transformism — that [Tarde] found in the work of such writers as Spencer, Espinas, Worms (whom he actually converted), de Greef, Gumplowicz, Novicow, Lombroso, Lilienfeld and Roberty’’ (1972: 302). Against these views, Tarde advanced his own, “interpsychological” theory, a form of methodological individualism based entirely on the notion of imitation. These critical essays provided the substance of Les lois de Limitation (1890), which would remain Tarde’s most famous sociological work; and with the publication of Les transformations du droit (1893), which examined various legal questions from a sociological perspective, Tarde’s sociological reputation was made. Appointed as director of criminal statistics at the Ministry of Justice — where his responsibilities included providing some of the statistical data for Le Suicide — Tarde moved from Bordeaux to Paris, and the confrontation with Durkheim began.

整个19世纪80年代，塔德在《评论哲学》上发表了一系列文章，斯蒂芬 · 卢克斯将其描述为“一个人对抗社会学中各种形式的生物主义ーー达尔文主义、有机体主义、变革主义ーー的运动，塔德在斯宾塞、埃斯皮纳斯、沃姆斯(他实际上改变了他的信仰)、德 · 格里夫、 Gumplowicz、 Novicow、隆布罗索、利连菲尔德和罗伯蒂等作家的作品中发现了这些形式的生物主义”(1972:302)。针对这些观点，塔尔德提出了自己的“心理间”理论，这是一种完全基于模仿概念的方法论的个人主义。这些批判性的文章提供了《有限的法律》(1890年)的实质内容，这仍然是塔尔德最著名的社会学著作; 随着《法律的转变》(1893年)的出版，从社会学的角度审视了各种法律问题，塔尔德的社会学声誉被树立起来。塔尔德被任命为司法部(Ministry of Justice)犯罪统计主任，他的职责包括为《自杀》杂志提供一些统计数据。他从波尔多搬到了巴黎，与涂尔干的冲突开始了。

The first shot was fired by Tarde in what Lukes has rightly described as a “generous and respectful” review of De la division du travail social (Tarde 1893: Lukes 1972: 304—5). In fact, Tarde’s review dealt not only with Durkheim’s doctoral thesis, but also with Novicow’s La lutte entre societes (1893) and the French edition of Gumplowicz’s Der Rassenkampf (1883), now re-titled as La lutte des races (1893). “This Russian, this Pole, and this Frenchman,’’ Tarde observed, “do not seem to know or to be mutually influenced by one another. Each has carved out and followed his own mental rut, his special furrow in the immense, fallow land of the sociological field’’ (1893: 618). The unconscious convergence and divergence of these independent lines of thought, Tarde suggested, form “the tissue of [the] new science’’ — particularly in their answers to two questions: “What is the nature of the social bond that ties together the parts of the group?’’ and “What is the law of social transformation?”

第一枪是由塔德发射的，卢克斯恰如其分地将其描述为对社会劳动分工的“慷慨和尊重”的评论(塔德1893: 卢克斯1972:304ー5)。事实上，塔德的评论不仅涉及涂尔干的博士论文，还涉及诺维科的《社会中的斗争》(1893年)和冈普洛维奇的《拉森坎普》(1883年)的法文版，现在改名为《种族斗争》(1893年)。“这个俄罗斯人、这个波兰人和这个法国人,”塔德说，“似乎并不认识彼此，也不相互影响。每个人都在社会学领域的广阔的休耕地上开拓出自己的心路历程，并遵循自己的心路历程”(1893:618)。塔德认为，这些独立思路的无意识趋同和分歧构成了“新科学的组织”ーー特别是在他们对两个问题的回答中: “将群体各部分联系在一起的社会纽带的本质是什么?”“社会转型的规律是什么?”

By contrast with the second question — which concerned “the most vital and anxious preoccupations of the present day’’ — Tarde suggested that the first “affords only theoretical interest’’; but he was also perceptibly delighted that not one of the three authors had adopted the Spencerian metaphor of the social organism. On the contrary, in Tarde's mind, each had been led to a conception of society that had broken “the umbilical cord of sociology,'' thus “inaugurating its autonomy'' from the “biological mother.'' In doing so, Tarde gratefully acknowledged, all three writers now granted a predominant role to the idea of social similitude — and thus to his own idea of imitation. In Durkheim's doctoral thesis, of course, what Tarde thus described as social similitude pertained primarily to primitive societies, whose solidarity was based on the resemblance between similar social segments (e.g., the clan, tribe, etc.) and their associated, individual members. But with increasing social differentiation and the division of labor, Tarde paraphrased Durkheim, this “mechanical” solidarity is replaced by a stronger, more intimate, bond based upon the differences between individuals and groups. Durkheim's answer to the first question thus turned heavily on his answer to the second — i.e., the law of social transformation.

与第二个问题相反，这个问题涉及“当今最重要和最令人焦虑的关注点”，塔尔德认为第一个问题“只能提供理论上的兴趣”; 但他也明显感到高兴的是，三位作者中没有一位采用了斯宾塞对社会有机体的比喻。相反，在 Tarde 的头脑中，每个人都被引向一个社会概念，这个概念已经打破了“社会学的脐带”，从而从“生物学母亲”那里“开启了它的自治”塔德感激地承认，这样一来，三位作家现在都赋予了社会相似性观念以主导地位，从而赋予了他自己的模仿观念以主导地位。当然，在迪尔凯姆的博士论文中，塔德所描述的社会相似性主要与原始社会有关，原始社会的团结是建立在相似的社会阶层(如氏族、部落等)及其相关的个体成员之间的相似性基础上的。但是随着社会分化和劳动分工的增加，塔德转述涂尔干的话说，这种“机械的”团结被一种基于个体和群体之间的差异的更强大、更亲密的纽带所取代。因此，涂尔干对第一个问题的回答，在很大程度上取决于他对第二个问题的回答ーー即社会转型规律。

Tarde's treatment of Durkheim's theory of social evolution was indeed generous and respectful. Durkheim “shows perfectly'' the inadequacy of the a priori, utilitarian explanation, Tarde observed, which derives the division of labor from the desire for material wellbeing. By contrast, Tarde added, Durkheim explains social differentiation as the consequence of “social things,'' and especially the increase in the volume and density of societies. More generally, the thesis contained “numerous perceptive remarks'' connected to each other in “ingenious ways,'' revealing Durkheim's “deep moral feeling and intelligence'' on “every page'' (1893: 626). But if Durkheim's theory of social change was thus true, Tarde continued, it was an incomplete truth, and one that invited serious misunderstanding. First, Tarde argued, it is imprecise to say that the segmentary (mechanically solidary) type of society is exclusively primitive. In fact, all societies — primitive and modern — are “segmentary,” in the sense that they are based on the similarity of their members and constituent groups. Admittedly, the segments grow larger — Tarde described contemporary Europe as a segmentary society comprised of nations rather than clans or tribes; and they also grow fewer in number, as the consequence of violent conflict, conquest, and political annexation — things that Durkheim's interpretation of the causes of the division of labor had largely ignored. “Through the multiplication of relations among individuals previously divided,'' Tarde insisted, “through their security and their growing productivity, the density of the group increased at the same time as its volume; and since ± according to Durkheim ± these are the generating causes of the division of labor, we see that [the division of labor] itself depends ... on the hazards of war, the abuse of force, on murder and great destruction” (1893: 627). But modern societies remain “segmentary,” bound together by similarities, and these similarities are themselves the consequence of imitation.

塔德对迪尔凯姆的社会进化理论的处理确实是慷慨和尊重的。涂尔干“完美地展示了”先验的、功利主义的解释的不足，塔德观察到，这种解释从物质福利的欲望中导出了劳动分工。相比之下，塔德补充说，迪尔凯姆解释说，社会分化是“社会事物”的结果，特别是社会数量和密度的增加。更广泛地说，这篇论文包含了“许多感性的评论”，它们以“巧妙的方式”相互联系，揭示了涂尔干在“每一页”(1893:626)上的“深刻的道德感和智慧”。但是，如果涂尔干的社会变革理论是如此真实，那么塔德继续说道，这是一个不完整的真理，而且会引起严重的误解。首先，塔德认为，不能准确地说分段(机械地团结)的社会类型完全是原始的。事实上，所有的社会ーー原始社会和现代社会ーー都是“分段的”，因为它们的基础是其成员和组成群体的相似性。不可否认，这些部分变得越来越大ーー塔德将当代欧洲描述为一个由民族而不是氏族或部落组成的部分社会; 由于暴力冲突、征服和政治吞并的结果，这些部分的数量也在减少ーー迪尔凯姆对劳动分工原因的解释基本上忽略了这一点。塔尔德坚持认为: “通过增加以前被分割的个体之间的关系，通过他们的安全和他们日益增长的生产力，群体的密度与其数量同时增加; 根据迪尔凯姆的说法，这些是分工的产生原因，我们看到[分工]本身取决于... ... 战争的危险，滥用武力，谋杀和大破坏”(1893:627)。但是现代社会仍然是“分割的”，由相似性联系在一起，而这些相似性本身就是模仿的结果。

Second, even as Tarde thus insisted that Durkheim's two causes for the division of labor ± the volume and density of populations ± were themselves consequences of conquest and annexation, he added a third, still more fundamental cause ± innovation. Countries like China and India, for example, have large, extremely dense populations without great industry or a complex division of social labor. By contrast, some European states (e.g., France) of moderate size and relatively dispersed populations have rapidly become highly organized, with complex systems of occupational specialization. Why? Tarde insisted that these European societies have simply been more innovative than their eastern counterparts. “It's always a new invention,'' Tarde explained, “which sustains a new branch of activity, which is the force which makes the division of labor ± not just in the economic, but also in the artistic, juristic, and scientihc senses of the word ± advance a step further'' (1893: 628). Tarde acknowledged the famous Darwinian argument ± so crucial to Durkheim ± to the effect that the likelihood of innovation itself increases proportionately to the struggle for existence. But again, Tarde argued, the Asiatic and African examples suggest that this law operates only to the extent that the innovations are relatively easy and obvious. Where they are difficult, the struggle for existence simply becomes doubly harsh, and the problems of the volume and density of population remain unresolved. Finally, as the examples of the locomotive and the telegraph imply, Durkheim had grossly underestimated the role played by the wholly accidental quality of individual genius in solving these problems, and thus in contributing to social progress. In sum, the primary causes of the division of labor appear to be, not the increase of population volume and density, but rather warfare and individual genius.

其次，尽管塔德坚持认为迪尔凯姆的两个劳动分工的原因 ± 人口的数量和密度 ± 本身就是征服和吞并的结果，他还增加了第三个，更为根本的原因 ± 创新。例如，像中国和印度这样的国家，人口数量庞大，密度极大，却没有大的工业，也没有复杂的社会劳动分工。相比之下，一些中等规模和人口相对分散的欧洲国家(例如法国)已经迅速变得高度组织化，具有复杂的职业专业化体系。为什么？塔德坚持认为，这些欧洲社会比东方社会更具创新精神。塔德解释说: “它总是一个新的发明，它支撑着一个新的活动分支，这种力量使得劳动分工不仅在经济上，而且在艺术、法律和科学意义上的分工更进一步”(1893:628)。塔德承认著名的达尔文主义论证对涂尔干是如此重要，以至于创新本身的可能性与生存斗争成比例增加。但是，塔德再次指出，亚洲和非洲的例子表明，这一法律只在创新相对容易和显而易见的情况下才起作用。在困难的地方，生存的斗争变得更加艰难，人口数量和密度的问题仍然没有得到解决。最后，正如火车头和电报的例子所暗示的那样，迪尔凯姆严重低估了个人天才在解决这些问题以及从而促进社会进步方面完全偶然的素质所发挥的作用。总之，劳动分工的主要原因似乎不是人口数量和密度的增加，而是战争和个人天赋的增加。

Similarly, Tarde argued that the most important functions of the division of labor cited by Durkheim ± i.e., the socializing and moralizing of citizens ± are achieved in some societies but not in all. “The division of labor contributes to socializing and moralizing,” Tarde insisted, “only at those times and places where ... it is tempered with a strong dose of similar beliefs or knowledge, of cult or of art, of customs or of rights and, far from contracting the domain of this higher communism, of this sacred individualism among fellow citizens, equal and similar at the base . . . tends to deepen and extend itself'' (1893: 628—9). In short, Tarde considered Durkheim's evolutionary opposition between mechanical and organic solidarity, in which the latter progressively replaces the for mer, an illusion. Tarde applauded Durkheim's acknowledgment that the division of labor itself presupposes a “community of beliefs and sentiments.''[78](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark90) [79](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark91) But he deplored Durkheim's failure to recognize that the function of the division of labor itself is “to develop and strengthen, under new forms, this intellectual and moral community, by multiplying the objects of this common wealth and singularly facilitating their diffusion'' (1893: 629). In some cases, organic solidarity even precedes its mechanical counterpart ± e.g., as where two nations or economic classes, previously foreign and dissimilar to one another, begin to render each other mutual services, exchanging merchandise, needs, and ideas, weaving the kinds of relations that assimilate them to one another and form the basis of community.

同样，塔德认为，迪尔凯姆引用的分工的最重要功能，即公民的社会化和道德化，在一些社会中实现，但并非在所有社会中实现。“劳动分工有助于社会化和道德化,”塔尔德坚持认为，“只有在那些时间和地点... ... 它受到大量类似信仰或知识、崇拜或艺术、习俗或权利的影响，而且，远远没有将这种神圣的个人主义纳入更高层次的共产主义的范畴，在公民之间，平等和相似的基础... ... 往往会加深和扩大自身”(1893:628ー9)。简而言之，塔德认为涂尔干在有机团结之间的进化对立是一种错觉，即后者逐渐取代了前者。塔德称赞涂尔干承认劳动分工本身预先假定了一个“信仰和情感的共同体”。但是他对涂尔干没有认识到劳动分工本身的功能是“在新的形式下，通过增加这种共同财富的目标和单一地促进它们的扩散，来发展和加强这种知识和道德共同体”(1893:629)表示遗憾。在某些情况下，有机的团结甚至先于机械的对应物，例如，两个国家或经济阶层，以前是外国的，彼此不同，开始互相服务，交换商品，需求和思想，编织各种关系，彼此同化，形成共同体的基础。

Durkheim responded to Tarde in the hrst part of “Les Regles de la methode sociologique'' (1894),11 at that point where he claimed to have delineated the “exact held” of sociology as embracing “one single, well dehned group of phenomena.'' A social fact, he explained, “is identihable through the power of external coercion which it exerts or is capable of exerting upon individuals.'' The presence of this power of external coercion, Durkheim continued, “is in turn recognisable because of the existence of some predetermined sanction, or through the resistance that the [social] fact opposes to any individual action that may threaten it'' (1982: 56—7). This was the classic dehnition of a social fact, which in Le Suicide would be clothed in the language of Du contrat social. But at this point in his argument, Durkheim added a second, alternative criterion whereby social facts might be dehned. Briefly, a social fact might also be identified “by ascertaining how widespread it is within the group, provided that, as noted above, one is careful to add a second essential characteristic; this is, that it exists independently of the particular forms that it may assume in the process of spreading itself within the group” (1982: 57). This alternative criterion of “generality plus objectivity,” Durkheim admitted, is sometimes “more easily applied” and “easier to establish,” especially in those instances -e.g., forms of economic organization like those to be treated in Le Suicide — where the initial criterion of “externality plus constraint” is “merely indirect” and thus “not always so clearly discernible.” But Durkheim insisted that this second criterion was simply another formulation of the first one, for “if a mode of behaviour existing outside the consciousnesses of individuals becomes general, it can only do so by exerting pressure upon them” (1982: 57).

迪尔凯姆在《社会学方法的规则》(1894)的 hrst 部分对 Tarde 做出了回应，11在这一点上，他声称已经描述了社会学的“精确控制”，即拥抱“一个单一的、深入人心的现象群体”他解释说，一个社会事实“可以通过对个人施加或能够施加的外部强制力来识别。”涂尔干继续说道，这种外部强制力量的存在“反过来也是可以被认可的，因为存在某种预先确定的制裁，或者通过[社会]事实反对任何可能威胁到它的个人行为的抵制”(1982:56ー7)。这是对一个社会事实的经典描述，在《自杀》一书中，这个事实被杜承包的社会语言所包裹。但在这一点上，迪尔凯姆在他的论点，增加了第二个，替代的标准，社会事实可能被剥夺。简而言之，一个社会事实也可以“通过确定它在群体中的广泛程度来识别，前提是，如上所述，一个人小心地添加第二个基本特征; 这就是，它独立于它在群体中传播过程中可能采取的特定形式而存在”(1982:57)。迪尔凯姆承认，这种“一般性加上客观性”的替代标准，有时候“更容易应用”和“更容易建立”，特别是在这些情况下——例如，像《自杀》中那样的经济组织形式——“外部性加上约束”的最初标准“仅仅是间接的”，因此“并不总是那么清晰可辨”但涂尔干坚持认为，第二个标准只是第一个标准的另一个表述，因为“如果存在于个人意识之外的行为模式变得普遍，它只能通过施加压力来做到这一点”(1982:57)。

The reader familiar with Les lois de Limitation, however, might reasonably have argued that such “generality plus objectivity” was the consequence of imitation; and it was apparently concerns of this kind that led Durkheim to a lengthy footnote emphasizing “how far removed this dehnition of the social fact is from that which serves as the basis for the ingenious system of Tarde.” Our research, Durkheim began, “has nowhere led us to corroboration of the preponderant influence that Tarde attributes to imitation in the genesis of collective facts.” Further, a necessary consequence of Durkheim’s definition of social facts was that “imitation does not always express, indeed never expresses, what is essential and characteristic in the social fact. Doubtless every social fact is imitated,’’ Durkheim acknowledged, “and has ... a tendency to become generalised.’’ But this tendency of a social fact to become generalized, he added, is because it is obligatory. “Its capacity for expansion is not the cause but the consequence of its sociological character.’’ If social facts were the only cause of such generalized expansion, Durkheim added, “imitation” might serve to define — but never explain — social facts; but “an individual state which impacts on [social states] none the less remains individual.” And Durkheim doubted that the term “imitation” could even serve thus to “designate” the kind of proliferation caused by social facts, for “[i]n such a single term very different phenomena, which need to be distinguished, are confused’’ (1982: 59 n. 3).

然而，熟悉《限制法》的读者可能会合理地争辩说，这种“普遍性加上客观性”是模仿的结果; 显然，正是这种关注导致涂尔干在一个长长的脚注中强调“这种对社会事实的否定与作为精巧的塔尔德体系基础的那种否定相去甚远。”我们的研究，涂尔干开始，“没有任何地方引导我们证实的优势影响，塔德归因于模仿在集体事实的起源。”此外，迪尔凯姆对社会事实定义的一个必然结果是“模仿并不总是表达，实际上从来没有表达，什么是社会事实的本质和特征。毫无疑问，每一个社会事实都是被模仿的,”涂尔干承认，“而且... ... 有一种趋向于被普遍化。”但是，他补充说，这种社会事实变得普遍化的趋势，是因为它是强制性的。“其扩张能力不是其社会学特征的原因，而是其结果。”迪尔凯姆补充说，如果社会事实是这种广义扩张的唯一原因，那么“模仿”可能有助于定义社会事实，但永远不能解释社会事实; 但“一个影响(社会事实)的个体状态仍然是个体状态。”迪尔凯姆甚至怀疑“模仿”这个术语是否可以用来“指定”由社会事实引起的那种扩散，因为“在这样一个单一的术语中，需要区分的非常不同的现象是混淆的”(1982:59 n. 3)。

Tarde responded to Durkheim in “Les Deux Elements de la sociologie,” a lecture presented before the First International Congress of Sociology, also in 1894. “It is natural,” Tarde referred to Durkheim’s earlier emphasis that social facts are a part of nature, “that a developing science lean on those already established, as for example sociology on biology.’’ And it is no less natural, he acknowledged, referring to Durkheim’s increasing emphasis that social facts are a particular part of nature — i.e., that a new science will “seek to fly on its own wings and to establish its own separate domain. Sociology has arrived at this point: it seeks to be established by itself and for itself’ (1969: 112). But however natural, it was this second, separatist tendency — i.e., the view that, though a science, sociology was a science of a special kind — that Tarde considered destructive to the discipline: “Everyone is aware of the sterility of these pretensions,” he insisted, “which refuse to recognize the solidarity of the various sciences, hence the profound unity of universal reality. The same vain aspirations are to be feared in sociology, and here and there I believe I can perceive symptoms of a similar error which could be disastrous’’ (1969: 112 — 13). It was to prevent this “aberration” — born of its Durkheimian pretension to “absolute autonomy’’ — that Tarde undertook his own effort to determine the scope and limits of sociology.

同样在1894年，塔德在第一届国际社会学大会上发表演讲，回应涂尔干的《社会学的两个要素》。“这是自然的,”塔德提到涂尔干早期强调的社会事实是自然的一部分，“发展中的科学依赖于那些已经建立起来的，例如生物社会学。”他承认，这也同样自然。他指的是迪尔凯姆越来越强调社会事实是自然的一个特定部分ーー也就是说，一门新的科学将“寻求凭借自己的翅膀飞翔，并建立自己独立的领域。”。社会学已经到了这一点: 它寻求自己建立和为自己’(1969:112)。然而，不管多么自然，正是这第二种分离主义倾向ーー也就是说，尽管社会学是一门科学，但它是一门特殊类型的科学的观点ーー使塔德认为它对这门学科具有破坏性: “每个人都意识到这些自命不凡的东西的无效性,”他坚持说，“它们拒绝承认各种科学的团结，因此是普遍现实的深刻统一。在社会学中，同样徒劳的愿望是可怕的，我相信在这里和那里，我可以察觉到类似错误的症状，这可能是灾难性的”(1969:112ー13)。正是为了防止这种“偏差”ーー源于涂尔干人对“绝对自治”的自命不凡ーー塔尔德自己努力确定了社会学的范围和界限。

In short, “Les Deux Elements de la sociologie’’ was Tarde’s rejoinder to the arguments of “Les Regles de la methode socio-logique,’’ and it concerned itself with two questions. The first was the determination of the distinctive character of social facts — i.e., those characteristics that distinguished them from other kinds of facts — a question that Tarde pursued using the analogy of mechanics. The elementary fact of mechanics, Tarde insisted, is not movement per se — which Tarde described instead as the mere “postulate” of mechanics — but rather the communication or modification of a specific movement by the action of one body on another. Similarly, he argued, the elementary fact of sociology is not consciousness — the mere “postulate” of sociology — but rather the “the communication or modification of a state of consciousness by the action of one conscious being on another’’ (1969: 113). From this distinction, it follows that some things done by members of a society, and particularly those things that are purely physiological or even psychological — e.g., breathing, digesting, blinking one’s eyelids, mechanically moving one’s legs about, absent-mindedly looking at a landscape, uttering an inarticulate cry, etc. — are not social facts at all. But other things - e.g., speaking to someone, praying to an idol, weaving a garment, cutting down a tree, knifing an enemy, sculpting a stone, etc. — rather clearly are social facts.

简而言之，《社会学的两个要素》是塔尔德对《社会学方法的规则》论点的回应，它涉及到两个问题。首先是确定社会事实的独特性ーー也就是那些区别于其他类型事实的特征ーー这是塔尔德利用力学类比追求的一个问题。塔尔德坚持认为，力学的基本事实不是运动本身ーー塔尔德把运动描述为仅仅是力学的“假设”ーー而是通过一个物体对另一个物体的作用来沟通或修改一个特定的运动。同样，他认为，社会学的基本事实不是意识ーー仅仅是社会学的“假设”ーー而是“通过一种意识存在对另一种意识存在的作用来交流或改变一种意识状态”(1969:113)。从这个区别可以看出，一个社会的成员所做的一些事情，特别是那些纯粹生理上甚至心理上的事情ーー例如呼吸、消化、眨眼睛、机械地移动双腿、漫不经心地看着风景、发出含糊不清的叫声等ーー根本不是社会事实。但是其他的事情，比如和某人说话，向偶像祈祷，织衣服，砍树，砍敌人，雕刻石头等等，这些显然是社会事实。

What distinguishes this second set of actions from the first? According to Tarde, actions of the second kind are social actions because they are imitative — i.e., human beings would not do these things but for the example of other human beings, whom they have copied, voluntarily or otherwise, from birth. It is in this sense that purely physical actions (e.g., walking, breathing, eating) can become social actions (e.g., walking in a regiment, breathing like a trained singer, eating with utensils). Only human beings perform actions of this second type. What about those (undeniably social) actions which consist of a new discovery, initiative, or invention? Tarde’s answer, suggestive of recent ideas in the sociology of scientific knowledge, was that such actions become “social” precisely to the extent that they quit the individual sphere, to be copied, replicated, and propagated by example, thus entering the public domain (1969: 114).

第二组动作与第一组动作有什么区别？按照塔德的说法，第二类行为是社会行为，因为它们是模仿性的ーー也就是说，人类不会做这些事情，而是以其他人为榜样，他们从出生起就自愿或以其他方式模仿这些人。从这个意义上说，纯粹的身体活动(例如，走路、呼吸、吃饭)可以成为社会活动(例如，在一个团里散步、像一个训练有素的歌手那样呼吸、用餐具吃饭)。只有人类才会做第二种动作。那些(不可否认的社会)行为包括一个新的发现，倡议或发明怎么办？塔德的回答，暗示了最近的科学知识社会学思想，这种行为变得“社会化”的程度恰恰是它们退出个人领域，被复制，复制，并通过例子传播，从而进入公共领域(1969:114)。

One of the more interesting claims that Tarde made for this distinction was that it takes no account of the motivation for the imitation. It makes no difference, Tarde insisted, whether the action is motivated by sympathy or animosity, envy or admiration, servile docility or a free and intelligent calculation. These extremely variable, subjective psychological elements could be set aside, for their underlying psychological source would still remain the same — i.e., a “certain hidden attraction” which “irresistibly pushes men to reflect each other’’ regardless of their other feelings or thoughts (1969: 114). The claim is important because it provided the occasion for Tarde’s “astonishment” at the reproaches made against him in “Les Regles’’: first, because Durkheim had criticized him for emphasizing a fact (imitation) that could be grasped externally and thus without regard for its internal source; and second, because it had been Durkheim — i.e., the foremost advocate of the principle that sociology should be based on purely objective, non-psychological considerations — who had entered this reproach. But for Tarde, of course, the real issue was Durkheim’s social realism.

Tarde 对这种区分提出的一个比较有趣的主张是，它没有考虑到模仿的动机。塔德坚持认为，无论这种行为的动机是同情还是敌意、嫉妒还是钦佩、顺从还是自由而明智的盘算，都没有什么区别。这些极易变化的、主观的心理因素可以放在一边，因为它们潜在的心理来源仍然是相同的ーー也就是说，一种“某种隐藏的吸引力”，它“不可抗拒地推动男人反映对方”，而不管他们的其他感觉或想法(1969:114)。这一主张之所以重要，是因为它为塔尔德提供了一个机会，让他对《法则》中对他的指责感到“震惊”: 首先，因为迪尔凯姆批评他强调一个事实(模仿) ，这个事实可以从外部把握，因此不考虑其内部来源; 其次，因为是迪尔凯姆——也就是社会学应该基于纯粹客观、非心理考虑这一原则的最重要倡导者——进入了这一指责。但是对于塔德来说，真正的问题当然是迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义。

In “Les Regles,’’ as we have seen, Durkheim had insisted that the generality of a fact in a given population was not itself a suf®cient criterion for calling it a social fact. For in addition — as Tarde correctly paraphrased and emphasized — each social fact “consists either of a belief, or a tendency, or a practice which is that of the group taken collectively and which is something quite different from the forms under which it is refracted in individuals.' But how, Tarde asked, could such a social fact be “refracted” before it exists? And how could it exist outside the minds of all individual human beings? “The truth,” Tarde epitomized the difference between his own view and that of Durkheim

在《规则》中，正如我们所看到的，迪尔凯姆坚持认为，一个事实在特定人群中的普遍性本身并不足以成为将其称为社会事实的标准。此外，正如塔德正确地解释和强调的那样，每个社会事实“包括一种信仰、一种趋势或一种实践，这种实践是集体的，与个体折射出来的形式完全不同。但是，塔德问道，这样一个社会事实在存在之前是如何“折射”的呢？它怎么可能存在于所有人类个体的意识之外呢？“真理,”塔德概括了他自己的观点和迪尔凯姆的观点之间的差异

is that any social thing, a word in a language, a religious rite, a trade secret, an artistic process, a legal provision, a moral maxim, is transmitted and passed not from the social group taken collectively to the individual, but from one individual — parent, teacher, friend, neighbor, comrade — to another individual, and in this passage from one mind to another it is refracted. (i969: 115)

任何社会事物，语言中的一个词语，宗教仪式，商业秘密，艺术过程，法律规定，道德准则，不是从社会群体传递给个人，而是从一个个体——父母，老师，朋友，邻居，同志——传递给另一个个体，在这个过程中，它从一个头脑到另一个头脑被折射。(i969:115)

It is the totality of these individual refractions — not Durkheim’s scholastic, ontological illusion — that constitutes social reality at any given time.

在任何给定的时间，构成社会现实的是这些个体折射的整体，而不是涂尔干的学术本体论幻象。

In fact, Tarde insisted, Durkheim’s argument itself presupposes the operation of these laws of imitation in precisely the manner described. This becomes clear when — in the passage from “Les Regles’’ that immediately follows the one just cited — Durkheim “irrefutably demonstrates” the “duality of kind’’ between individual and social facts by pointing to their empirical dissociation:

事实上，塔尔德坚持认为，迪尔凯姆的论点本身就预先假定了这些模仿规律的运作方式正是所描述的。这一点在迪尔凯姆“无可辩驳地证明”个人事实和社会事实之间的“二元性”时就变得清晰起来——在紧接着刚才引用的那一段的《规则》中，迪尔凯姆指出了个人事实和社会事实之间的经验分离:

Indeed some of these ways of acting or thinking acquire, by dint of repetition, a sort of consistency which, so to speak, separates them out, isolating them from the particular events which reflect them. Thus they assume a shape, a tangible form peculiar to them and constitute a reality sui generis vastly distinct from the individual facts which manifest that reality. Collective custom does not exist only in a state of immanence in the successive actions which it determines, but, by a privilege without example in the biological kingdom, expresses itself once and for all in a formula repeated by word of mouth, transmitted by education and even enshrined in the written word. (1982: 54—5)

事实上，这些行为或思维方式中的一些通过重复获得了某种一致性，可以说，这种一致性将它们与反映它们的特定事件区分开来。因此，它们呈现出一种特有的形状，一种有形的形式，并构成一种独特的现实，与表现这种现实的个别事实大相径庭。集体习俗不仅存在于它决定的连续行动中的内在状态，而且通过生物王国中没有先例的特权，以口头重复、通过教育传播甚至写入文字的方式一劳永逸地表达自己。(1982:54ー5)

However unconsciously and involuntarily, Tarde emphasized, Durkheim has here acknowledged the powerfully socializing nature of imitation — i.e., an action, frequently repeated, gives rise to a collective habit; the habit in turn becomes verbally articulated; and the repetition of the verbal formula leads to further communication and thus imitation.

塔德强调说，无论是无意识的还是无意识的，涂尔干在这里已经承认了模仿的强大的社会化本质ーー即，一个动作，经常重复，产生一个集体习惯; 习惯反过来变得口头清晰; 重复口头公式导致进一步的交流，从而模仿。

In sum, wherever Durkheim insisted that social facts are characterized by “generality-plus-independence” (Lukes 1972: 14—15), Tarde might embrace the notion of “generality,” but found the criterion of “independence” — i.e., the idea that social facts must be dissociated from their individual manifestations — incomprehensible. But even for Durkheim, “generality-plus-independence” was rarely more than a sign by which social facts might be recognized, not an essential aspect of their nature. Far more important for Durkheim were the criteria of externality and constraint — features that Tarde found “scarcely less surprising” than that of independence. If constraint were a characteristic of social facts, for example, then there would be nothing more “social” than the relationship between a victor and the vanquished, and nothing less social than the spontaneous conversion of an entire people to a new religious faith or political ideology. Thinking of social facts as external to the individual, Tarde explained, Durkheim felt that they could “enter” the individual mind only by “imposition” and coercion, a mistaken conception that would be generalized in Durkheim’s “harsh and restrictive'' theory of education. Tarde, by contrast, insisted that the basis of all education is the innate sociability of the child, without which all educational discipline and coercion is pointless (1969: 119).

总而言之，无论迪尔凯姆坚持社会事实的拥有属性是“一般性加上独立性”(卢克斯1972:14ー15) ，塔德可能会接受“一般性”的概念，但发现“独立性”的标准ーー即社会事实必须与其个别表现分离的观点ーー是不可理解的。但即使对涂尔干来说，“普遍性加上独立性”也只不过是社会事实得到承认的一个标志，而不是其本质的一个重要方面。对涂尔干来说，外部性和约束性的标准更为重要ーー塔德认为这些特征与独立性的标准相比，“几乎没有什么不令人惊讶的”。例如，如果约束是社会事实的一个特征，那么没有什么比胜利者和被征服者之间的关系更“社会化”了，也没有什么比整个民族自发地转变为一种新的宗教信仰或政治意识形态更“社会化”了。塔尔德解释说，迪尔凯姆认为社会事实是个体之外的，只有通过“强加”和强制才能“进入”个体的思想，这是一个错误的概念，可以在迪尔凯姆的“严厉和限制性”的教育理论中得到推广。相比之下，塔德坚持认为，所有教育的基础是孩子与生俱来的社交能力，没有这种能力，所有的教育纪律和强制都是毫无意义的(1969:119)。

This brought Tarde to what he considered (quite accurately) to be the primary desiderata of Durkheim’s social realism — i.e., the notion that a combination of individual elements can produce a reality sui generis, greater than the sum of its parts. Tarde recognized that this notion, far from being limited to Durkheim alone, was “very widespread among cultivated minds’’ (1969: 120). And he was equally aware that the appeal of this idea lay in chemical and biological analogues — e.g., the combination of lifeless chemicals yielding life, of unconscious biological cells yielding individual consciousness, etc. “After this,’’ Tarde acknowledged, “we ought not to judge it surprising a priori that the social meeting of different selves should bring forth [a society], which is supposedly something super-psychological, or essentially nonpsychological, and which exists independently of all individual consciousnesses” (1969: 121).

这使得塔德认为(相当准确地)是迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义的主要目标ーー也就是说，个体元素的组合可以产生一个独特的现实，大于其各部分的总和。塔德认识到，这个概念，远不仅仅局限于涂尔干，“在有教养的心灵中非常普遍”(1969:120)。他同样意识到这个观点的吸引力在于化学和生物学的类似物ーー例如，产生生命的无生命的化学物质的结合，产生个体意识的无意识生物细胞的结合等等。“在这之后,”塔德承认，“我们不应该先验地判断不同自我的社会会面应该产生[一个社会] ，这个社会应该是超心理的，或者说基本上是非心理的，并且独立于所有个体意识而存在”(1969:121)。

But it is precisely here, Tarde argued, that the analogy breaks down. For in the case of chemistry and biology, we are completely ignorant of what goes on in the depths of the individual element, while in psychology and sociology, we have an increasingly intimate, empirical knowledge of the individual human minds making up the whole. Moreover, on the basis of this empirical knowledge, we are able to affirm that “without the individual element the social element is nothing, and that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in society which does not exist piecemeal in a state of continual repetition in living individuals.” To Tarde, this meant that the individual minds “contain within themselves the complete explanation and the complete existence of their composite [i.e., society]” (1969: 121, 122). Where Durkheim had insisted that “the determining cause of a social fact must be sought among antecedent social facts, and not among the states of the individual consciousness,” therefore, Tarde instead embraced the emphasis on collective psychology and history that he had discovered in Comte, Mill, and Spencer (Durkheim 1982: 134; Tarde 1969: 122).

但正是在这里，塔德认为，这个类比被打破了。因为在化学和生物学的例子中，我们完全不知道在个体元素的深处发生了什么，而在心理学和社会学中，我们对构成整体的个体人类思维有着越来越深入的、经验性的了解。此外，基于这种经验知识，我们可以肯定，“没有个人因素，社会因素就什么都不是，在社会中，没有任何东西，绝对没有，在活着的个人不断重复的状态下，不存在零碎的东西。”对于塔德来说，这意味着个体的思想“包含在他们自己内部的完整的解释和他们合成的完整的存在[即，社会]”(1969:121,122)。迪尔凯姆坚持认为“社会事实的决定性原因必须在先前的社会事实中寻找，而不是在个体意识的状态中寻找。”因此，塔尔德转而接受了他在 Comte、密尔和斯宾塞(迪尔凯姆1982:134; 塔尔德1969:122)中发现的对集体心理学和历史的强调。

There can be little doubt that Durkheim was deeply troubled by this quarrel with Tarde. As a dilettante who dabbled in literary circles, frequented the Parisian salons, opposed socialism, and favored an intellectual aristocracy, Tarde epitomized most of the things that Durkheim loathed. In 1898, having resolved to end the exchange, Durkheim would write to Xavier Leon, urging him to publish his “Representations individuelles et representations collectives'' as soon as possible lest Tarde think that it was a reply to his most recent attack.[80](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark92) And when Tarde was appointed to the chair in modern philosophy at the College de France, Durkheim would again write to Leon that he regretted, “for the sake of both sociology and philosophy, both of which have an equal interest in remaining distinct, a confusion which shows that many good minds still fail to understand what each should be.”[81](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark93) In particular, Tarde had struck at the heart of Durkheim’s sociological enterprise — i.e., the independent reality of social facts and their irreducibility to psychological explanations. As he responded, Durkheim apparently renewed his acquaintance with the works of Rousseau — with powerful consequences for his sociological vocabulary.

毫无疑问，迪尔凯姆对与塔尔德的这场争吵深感不安。作为一个涉足文学界、经常光顾巴黎沙龙、反对社会主义、支持知识分子贵族的业余爱好者，塔德集中体现了涂尔干所厌恶的大部分东西。1898年，在决定结束这种交流后，迪尔凯姆写信给泽维尔 · 利昂，敦促他尽快出版他的《个人和集体的表述》 ，以免塔德认为这是对他最近的攻击的回应。当塔德被任命为法兰西学院现代哲学系主任时，迪尔凯姆再次写信给利昂，表示他后悔，“为了社会学和哲学，两者都有同样的兴趣保持不同，这种混乱表明，许多优秀的头脑仍然无法理解每个应该是什么。”特别是，塔尔德触及了迪尔凯姆社会学事业的核心ーー即社会事实的独立现实性及其对心理学解释的不可还原性。迪尔凯姆回答说，他显然重新认识了卢梭的作品，这对他的社会学词汇产生了强大的影响。

THE CONDITION OF HAPPinESS

幸福的状态

The notion that Rousseau had a significant impact on Durkheim’s thought is hardly new. Robert Derathee, for example, has insisted that Durkheim “was fully aware of having been influenced by Rousseau, who was one of his favorite authors’’ (1950: 338). Sheldon Wolin has argued that Durkheim’s sociology is “the purest restatement of Rousseau . . . the medium, so to speak, by which Rousseau has left his mark on modern social science” (i960: 372). And most recently, Mark Cladis has encouraged us to see Durkheim’s work “as his effort to advance, in theory and in practice, Rousseau’s vision of a harmonious pluralistic society in the context of the industrial age’’ (1992: 9).

认为卢梭对涂尔干思想有重大影响的观点并不新鲜。例如，罗伯特 · 德拉西坚持认为涂尔干“完全意识到自己受到了卢梭的影响，卢梭是他最喜欢的作家之一”(1950:338)。谢尔顿•沃林(Sheldon Wolin)辩称，涂尔干的社会学是“对卢梭最纯粹的重述... ... 可以说，是卢梭在现代社会科学中留下印记的媒介”(i960:372)。最近，马克 · 克拉迪斯鼓励我们把涂尔干的作品看作是“在理论和实践上推进卢梭在工业时代背景下构建和谐多元社会的努力”(1992:9)。

The initial difficulty facing such claims, however, is that the evidence of Durkheim’s early writings runs consistently in the opposite direction. In the Sens lectures, for example, we saw that Durkheim objected to Rousseau’s conceptions of the social contract, altruism, socialism, ethics, and education as well. In his early review of Schaeffle’s Bau und Leben, Durkheim was pleased to observe that “[w]e are not dealing with man as Rousseau conceived of him . . . that abstract being, born to solitude, renouncing it only very late and by a sort of voluntary sacrifice, and then only as the issue of a well-deliberated covenant. Every man is, on the contrary, born for society and in a society.’’ Rousseau’s “savage individualism,” Durkheim continued, “is not part of nature. The real man — the man who is truly a man — is an integral part of a society which he loves just as he loves himself, because he cannot withdraw from it without becoming decadent.’’ By showing that sociology has a subject matter no less real than that of the life sciences, Schaeffle had thus dealt the “final blow’’ to the doctrines of Hobbes and Rousseau (Durkheim 1885a: 98). Just one year later, in his review of Schaeffle’s Die Quintessenz des Sozialismus, Durkheim criticized “the simplistic conception of Rousseau, to which the economic school adheres doggedly, and this after a century of experiences which hardly seem to have been favorable to the theory of the Contrat social’ (1886a: 78—9). On his return from Germany, Durkheim criticized both the Manchester economists and the Kathedersozialisten as “unwitting disciples of Rousseau’’ who “see in the social bond only a super®cial rapprochement, determined by the meeting of interests’’ (1887b: 37). If we wish to understand German political ideas, Durkheim added in the companion essay, “[w]e must not judge with our French ideas. . . For the German, the State is not what it is for us — a great machine destined to compromise this multitude of unsociable beings as Rousseau imagined.’’ Unfortunately, Durkheim concluded, we “have only half-heartedly disowned the Contrat social’ (1887a: 337—8).

然而，面临这种说法的最初困难在于，迪尔凯姆早期著作的证据始终朝着相反的方向运行。例如，在森斯的讲座中，我们看到涂尔干反对卢梭的社会契约、利他主义、社会主义、伦理和教育等概念。涂尔干在早期评论舍费尔的《包与生命》(Bau und Leben)时，很高兴地注意到，“我们并没有像卢梭想象的那样与人打交道... ... 那个抽象的存在，诞生于孤独之中，只是在很晚的时候才放弃孤独，而且是通过某种自愿的牺牲，然后只是作为一个经过深思熟虑的契约的问题。”。相反，每个人都是为社会而生，为社会而生。”迪尔凯姆继续说道，卢梭的“野蛮的个人主义”并不是自然的一部分。真正的男人ーー真正的男人ーー是社会不可分割的一部分，他爱社会就像爱自己一样，因为他不能退出社会而不堕落。”通过证明社会学的主题不亚于生命科学的主题，谢弗因此对霍布斯和卢梭的学说进行了“最后一击”(涂尔干1885a: 98)。仅仅一年之后，涂尔干在评论谢弗尔的《社会主义的五要素》时，批评了“经济学派固执地坚持的简单化的卢梭概念，这是在一个世纪的经验之后，似乎很难有利于契约社会理论”(1886a: 78ー9)。从德国回来后，涂尔干批评曼彻斯特的经济学家和凯瑟琳的社会主义者都是“不知情的卢梭的信徒”，他们“认为社会纽带只是一种超级的社会和解，由利益集会决定”(1887b: 37)。如果我们希望理解德国的政治思想，涂尔干在配套文章中补充道: “我们绝不能用我们的法国思想来判断... ... 对德国人来说，国家不是它对我们来说意味着什么ーー一台注定要妥协于卢梭所想象的这么多不合群的人的伟大机器。”不幸的是，涂尔干总结道，我们“只是半心半意地否认了契约社会”(1887a: 337ー8)。

Arriving in Bordeaux, Durkheim began his inaugural lecture with an attack on that idea “which radically prevented the establishment of sociology’’ — i.e., the notion of society “as a human creation, a product of art and reflection’’ (1978a: 44). According to this view, Durkheim added, “there is nothing in the nature of man which necessarily predestined him to collective life; he himself invented it and established it. Whether it is everyone's creation, as Rousseau argues, or that of a single man, as Hobbes thinks, it derived in its entirety from our brains and from our imaginations” (1978a: 45). Is the ideal for societies, Durkheim asked of Spencer, “the ferocious individualism which Rousseau made their point of departure? Is positive politics just the Social Contract all over again?'' (1978a: 58). “If man is essentially a whole, an individual and egoistic being,'' Durkheim again objected in his 1890 review of Ferneuil's Les Principes de 1789 et la science sociale, “if he has no other objective than the development of his moral personality (Kant) or the satisfaction of his needs with the least possible effort (Bastiat), society appears as something against nature, as a violence wreaked upon our most fundamental propensities. Rousseau avows this, or rather proclaims it'' (1973b: 39).

到达波尔多后，涂尔干开始了他的就职演讲，抨击了“从根本上阻碍了社会学建立”的观点，即社会的概念是“人类的创造，艺术和反思的产物”(1978a: 44)。根据这一观点，迪尔凯姆补充道: “人的本性中没有什么必然注定了他要过集体生活; 是他自己创造并建立了集体生活。无论是卢梭认为的每个人的创造，还是霍布斯认为的一个人的创造，它都完全来源于我们的大脑和想象力”(1978a: 45)。迪尔凯姆问斯宾塞，社会的理想是否是“卢梭提出的出发点所指的凶猛的个人主义？积极政治只是社会契约的重演吗?”(1978a: 58).迪尔凯姆在1890年对费尔内伊的《1789年的原则与社会科学》(Les Principes de 1789 et la science sociale)的评论中再次表示反对: “如果人本质上是一个整体、一个个体和利己主义的存在，如果他除了发展自己的道德人格(康德)或用尽可能少的努力来满足自己的需求(巴斯夏)以外没有其他目标，社会看起来就像是某种违背自然的东西，就像是对我们最基本的倾向施加。卢梭承认这一点，或者更确切地说是宣告了这一点”(1973b: 39)。

In De la division du travail social (1893), Durkheim insisted that the notion of a social contract contradicts the principle of the division of labor. “The greater the importance one ascribes to the latter,'' Durkheim thus emphasized, “the more completely must one abandon Rousseau's postulate'' (1984: 150). For such a contract requires that all individual wills should be in agreement on the foundations of social organization; in short, the content of each individual consciousness would be identical to every other. If social solidarity arises from a social contract, Durkheim concluded, then it has no connection to the division of labor. Durkheim acknowledged Rousseau's recognition that the hypothesized state of nature prior to the contract must necessarily be amoral. “Man is only a moral being because he lives in society,'' Durkheim agreed, “since morality consists in solidarity with the group, and varies according to that solidarity. Cause all social life to vanish, and moral life would vanish at the same time, having no object to cling to'' (1984: 331—2). But Les Regles de la methode sociologique (1895) simply repeated the argument that had by now become de rigueur. Durkheim complained:

在《社会劳动分工》(1893)一书中，涂尔干坚持认为社会契约的概念与劳动分工的原则相矛盾。迪尔凯姆因此强调: “人们越是重视后者，就越是必须完全放弃卢梭的假设”(1984:150)。因为这种契约要求所有的个人意志都应该在社会组织的基础上达成一致; 简而言之，每个个人意识的内容应该是相同的。涂尔干总结说，如果社会团结源于社会契约，那么它与劳动分工就没有关系。涂尔干承认卢梭承认合同之前的假设自然状态必然是不道德的。“人之所以是道德的存在，是因为他生活在社会中,”涂尔干同意道，“因为道德是与群体团结在一起的，并且根据这种团结而变化。使一切社会生活消失，道德生活也同时消失，没有依附的对象”(1984:331ー2)。但是《社会学方法的规则》(1895)只是重复了现在已经成为必要的论点。迪尔凯姆抱怨道:

Neither Hobbes nor Rousseau, appear to have noticed the complete contradiction that exists in admitting that the individual is himself the creator of a machine whose essential role is to exercise domination and constraint over him. Alternatively, it may have seemed to them that, in order to get rid of this contradiction, it was sufficient to conceal it from the eyes of its victims by the skilful device of the social contract. (1982: 142)

无论是霍布斯还是卢梭，似乎都没有注意到，承认个体本身就是一台机器的创造者，而这台机器的基本作用就是对个体进行控制和约束，这是完全自相矛盾的。或者，在他们看来，为了消除这种矛盾，只要利用社会契约的巧妙手段将矛盾隐藏起来，就足够了。(1982:142)

Durkheim’s more positive assessment of Rousseau thus seems to have emerged later, around 1896. By this time, as we’ve just seen, he had become exhausted and frustrated by his debate with Tarde; and as a Dreyfusard from a relatively early date, Durkheim had also become involved in the Ligue pour la Defense des Droits de 1’Homme. In 1896, at the grave of a Bordeaux colleague, Durkheim gave an outspokenly Dreyfusard eulogy that caused something of a sensation; and he went on to organize and become secretary of the Bordeaux branch of the Ligue (Lukes 1972: 347—8). When the anti-Dreyfusard Ferdinand Brunetiere defended the army and the Right against the threats of Dreyfusard “anarchy” and “individualism,” Durkheim responded with “Individualism and the Intellectuals” (1898), which embraced the “moral individualism” of Kant and Rousseau — “the one which the Declaration of the Rights of Man attempted, more or less happily, to formulate and which is currently taught in our schools and has become the basis of our moral catechism’’ (1973c: 45). As Mark Cladis has argued quite persuasively, this embracement of “moral” individualism (by contrast with its “egoistic” counterpart) enabled Durkheim to forge a “communitarian defense of liberalism'' — one that respected the dignity and rights of individuals while still preserving the moral idiom of social tradition and the commitment to the common good (1992: 1 — 28).

因此，涂尔干对卢梭更为积极的评价似乎是在1896年左右出现的。到这个时候，正如我们刚才所看到的，他已经因为和塔尔德的争论而精疲力尽和沮丧; 作为一个早期的德雷福萨尔，涂尔干也加入了保卫人权联盟。1896年，在一位波尔多同事的墓前，涂尔干发表了一篇直言不讳的德雷福萨尔悼词，引起了轰动; 他继续组织并成为法律联盟波尔多分会的秘书(卢克斯1972:347ー8)。当反对德雷福萨的布吕内蒂埃捍卫军队和右翼抵抗德雷福萨的“无政府主义”和“个人主义”的威胁时，涂尔干用“个人主义和知识分子”(1898)作为回应，它拥抱了康德和卢梭的“道德个人主义”ーー“这是《人权宣言》或多或少愉快地尝试制定的，目前在我们的学校里教授，并已成为我们道德问答的基础”(1973c: 45)。正如马克 · 克拉迪斯(Mark Cladis)极具说服力的论述，这种对“道德”个人主义的接受(与其“利己主义”对应物相反)使涂尔干能够建立起一种“自由主义的共同防御”ーー一种在尊重个人尊严和权利的同时仍然保留社会传统的道德习语和对共同利益的承诺的共同防御(1992:1ー28)。

So after 1896 — whether to respond to reactionary anti-Dreyfusards like Brunetiere or to social psychologists like Tarde — Durkheim committed himself to a deeper reading of Rousseau. While still at Bordeaux, he taught a lecture-course on Rousseau's Contrat social (1762), for which — as was his custom — he wrote out his lecture notes in extenso.[82](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark94) Later he redrafted these for publication, promising them to Xavier Leon, editor of the Revue de metaphysique et de morale. To this study of the Contrat social he then conjoined some notes on Emile, from a later course on Rousseau's educational theory he had taught twice in Paris. Though “not generally realised,’’ Durkheim explained, the two themes are “closely linked’’ (1979: 162). Upon his death, the executors of Durkheim’s works decided to publish both the study of the Contrat social and the less developed notes on Emile in the Revue de metaphysique et de morale, where they appeared in 1918 and 1919, respectively.

因此，1896年之后ーー无论是回应布鲁内蒂埃这样的反对德雷福斯的保守派，还是回应塔尔德这样的社会心理学家ーー涂尔干致力于更深入地解读卢梭。在波尔多期间，他教授了一门关于卢梭的《社会契约论》(1762年)的讲座课程，按照他的习惯，他把讲座笔记全文写下来。82后来，他重新起草了这些笔记以供出版，并把它们许诺给《形而上学与道德》的编辑泽维尔 · 利昂(Xavier Leon)。在研究契约社会的过程中，他还结合了一些关于埃米尔的笔记，这些笔记来自于他在巴黎教过两次的关于卢梭教育理论的后续课程。涂尔干解释说，虽然“没有普遍意识到”，但这两个主题是“密切相关的”(1979:162)。迪尔凯姆去世后，他作品的执行者们决定出版《社会契约论》和《形而上学与道德论》中关于埃米尔的不太成熟的笔记，这两本书分别出版于1918年和1919年。

“The chief objective of The Social Contract,' Durkheim began, “[is] to ®nd a form of association, or, as Rousseau also calls it, of civil state, whose laws can be superimposed upon the fundamental laws inherent in the state of nature without doing violence to them.” Implicit within this objective, of course, was Rousseau’s judgment that such a form of association had not yet been found, for men had deviated from their original, natural condition, and they had done so unnecessarily. To understand Rousseau, Durkheim thus observed, we must learn what he meant by the “state of nature,’’ and then deter mine how it is that we came to depart from this original, natural condition. “Only then,’’ Durkheim summarized his problem, “shall we be in a position to examine Rousseau’s reasons for believing that this deviation was not inevitable, and his remarks as to how the two [natural and civil] states, at variance in several respects, can be reconciled” (1960c: 66).

迪尔凯姆开篇写道: “《社会契约论》的主要目的是建立一种公民国家的联合形式，卢梭也称之为公民国家，其法律可以叠加在自然状态所固有的基本法律之上，而不会对它们施加暴力。”当然，在这个目标中隐含着卢梭的判断，即这种形式的联系还没有被发现，因为人们已经偏离了他们最初的自然状态，而且他们这样做是不必要的。迪尔凯姆这样评论道，要理解卢梭，我们必须了解他所说的“自然状态”是什么意思，然后确定我们是如何背离这种原始的自然状态的。“只有这样,”涂尔干总结了他的问题，“我们才能审视卢梭认为这种背离不是不可避免的理由，以及他关于两个(自然和文明)国家，在几个方面的差异，如何可以调和的言论”(1960c: 66)。

As Rousseau made clear in the Discours sur l’origine de l’inegalite (1755), Durkheim observed, his “state of nature’’ was a psychological, rather than historical, construct ±i.e., it was not a condition in which human beings actually lived before societies came into being, but rather a device to help us distinguish between those things that we owe to society, and those that we owe to our psychological nature. The distinction was important to Rousseau, Durkheim emphasized, because he shared the “traditional confusion’’ which conceives the “natural” as coextensive with the “individual,” and everything that goes beyond the individual - i.e., society - as “artificial.’’ Our present forms of association either follow logically from human nature, Rousseau observed, or they deform it. The critical assessment of these forms, as well as the determination of what forms should replace them, must therefore begin with an analysis of man in his natural condition. And “to arrive at this natural man,’’ Durkheim paraphrased Rousseau, “we must put aside everything within us that is a product of social existence. Otherwise, we should ®nd ourselves in a vicious circle, for we should be justifying society on the basis of society, that is, of the ideas and feelings society has implanted in us.’’[83](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark95)

正如卢梭在《论不平等的起源》(1755)中明确指出的，涂尔干认为，他的“自然状态”是一种心理上的，而不是历史上的，建构 ± ，也就是说，它不是一种人类在社会形成之前实际生活的状态，而是一种帮助我们区分我们对社会所欠的东西和我们对心理本质所欠的东西的工具。涂尔干强调，这种区分对卢梭来说很重要，因为他同意“传统的混淆”，即认为“自然”与“个人”同时延伸，而超越个人的一切——即社会——都是“人造的”卢梭观察到，我们目前的联想形式要么遵循人性的逻辑，要么扭曲人性。因此，对这些形式的批判性评估，以及确定什么样的形式应该取代它们，必须从分析人的自然状况开始。涂尔干解释卢梭的话说: “要达到这种自然人的境界，我们必须抛开我们内心的一切，那是社会存在的产物。”。否则，我们就会陷入一个恶性循环，因为我们应该在社会的基础上，也就是社会植入我们的思想和感情的基础上，为社会辩护。”83

Durkheim was impressed with the extent to which this observation of Rousseau’s second Discours was essentially methodological, and also with how much it owed to Descartes:

迪尔凯姆对卢梭第二篇论述的这种观察在多大程度上是方法论的印象深刻，同时也对它在多大程度上归功于笛卡尔留下了深刻印象:

Both [Descartes and Rousseau] hold that the first operation of science should be a kind of intellectual purge that will clear the mind of all mediate judgments that have not been demonstrated scientifically and lay bare the axioms from which all other propositions should be derived. Both set out to remove the rubble and uncover the solid rock on which the entire structure of knowledge should rest; in the one case theoretical knowledge, in the other practical knowledge.

笛卡尔和卢梭都认为，科学的第一次运作应该是一种知识的清洗，这种清洗可以清除所有未经科学证明的中介判断，并揭示所有其他命题应该从中衍生出来的公理。两者都着手清除瓦砾，揭示整个知识结构所应依赖的坚实岩石; 在一种情况下，是理论知识，在另一种情况下，是实践知识。

It was in this sense that Durkheim denied that Rousseau’s notion of the state of nature was in any sense romantic — e.g., that it was “a figment of sentimental reverie,’’ or “a philosophical restoration of the ancient belief in the golden age’’ (1960c: 69). On the contrary, Rousseau’s observation of lower animals, combined with the theory of Condillac, convinced Rousseau that even the simplest forms of abstract knowledge presuppose language, while language itself presupposes social life (1994: 33). So, as Durkheim himself would later insist in his essay on “La Determination du fait moral’’ (1906), Rousseau’s conception of man in the state of nature was that of a being “reduced to sensation and hardly different from an animal’’ (Durkheim 1974b: 55; Rousseau 1994: 34).

正是在这个意义上，迪尔凯姆否认卢梭的自然状态概念在任何意义上都是浪漫的ーー例如，它是“一个虚构的情感幻想”，或“一个在黄金时代的古老信仰的哲学恢复”(1960c: 69)。相反，卢梭对低等动物的观察，结合康迪拉克的理论，使卢梭相信，即使是最简单的抽象知识形式都是以语言为前提的，而语言本身则是以社会生活为前提的(1994:33)。因此，正如涂尔干后来在他的论文《道德的决定》(1906)中所坚持的那样，卢梭对自然状态下的人的概念是一种“被降低为感觉的存在，与动物几乎没有什么不同”(涂尔干1974b: 55; 卢梭1994:34)。

This dismissal of any romantic interpretation of Rousseau was important, because it allowed Durkheim to focus on what he considered the most essential aspect of Rousseau’s notion of the state of nature. Precisely because Rousseau’s natural man was reduced exclusively to sensations, Durkheim observed, he could desire only those things found in his immediate physical environment; and thus his desires would necessarily be purely physical and extremely simple, resulting in “a perfect balance between his needs and the resources at his disposal’’ (1960c: 70; Rousseau 1994: 35). Under these circumstances, Durkheim emphasized, “man is in harmony with his environment because he is a purely physical being, dependent on his physical environment and nothing else. The nature within him necessarily corresponds to the nature without’’ (1960c: 71).

这种对卢梭浪漫主义解释的否定很重要，因为它使涂尔干能够专注于他所认为的卢梭自然状态概念最基本的方面。涂尔干观察到，正是因为卢梭笔下的自然人被归结为纯粹的感觉，他只能渴望那些在他眼前的物质环境中发现的东西; 因此他的欲望必然是纯粹的物质的和极其简单的，导致“他的需求和他所支配的资源之间的完美平衡”(1960c: 70; 卢梭1994:35)。在这种情况下，涂尔干强调，“人与他的环境是和谐的，因为他是一个纯粹的物质存在，依赖于他的物质环境，而不是其他任何东西。他内在的本性必然与没有的本性相对应”(1960c: 71)。

To Durkheim, this explained Rousseau’s famous rejection of the equally famous argument of Hobbes, in Leviathan (1651), that the state of nature was a state of war (Hobbes 1958: 107). First, in a condition where needs were exactly proportionate to the resources necessary to satisfy them, the incentive to war - i.e., unsatisfied needs - was lacking. And second, pace Hobbes, Rousseau was persuaded that the primitive, unreflective form of identihcation that led to the feeling of pity was present in animals, and therefore also in natural man (1960c: 71—2; Rousseau 1994: 45—6). Durkheim admitted that, in the Essai sur 1’origine des langues (1781), Rousseau seemed to contradict this second argument, leading some scholars to argue that his later work moved more in the direction of Hobbes and his theory of the state of war (Rousseau 1966: 32). But Durkheim resisted this interpretation, arguing that the later passage simply referred to the reflection necessary before the natural sentiment of pity — initially limited to that small circle of individuals with whom the natural man had relations — could be extended to all mankind. At most, therefore, the Essai was “a clarification and partial correction of the idea developed in the second Discours.”[84](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark96) But if Rousseau thus denied Hobbes’ equivalence of the state of nature with the state of war, neither did he suggest that natural man lived in “societies” properly so-called. Instinct and sensation sufficed for all his needs, and lacking imagination, he could not conceive of any bene®ts society might afford. Nor did he possess language, without which social relationships would be impossible. Natural man was thus not unsocial, but asocial; and similarly, he was not immoral, but amoral. “Thanks to a very wise providence,” Rousseau observed, “his potential faculties developed only with the opportunities to use them, so that they were neither superfluous nor prematurely onerous, nor belated and unavailing when they were needed. In instinct alone man had everything he needed to live in the state of nature, and in cultivated reason, he has everything he needs to live in society’’ (1960c: 74—5; Rousseau 1994: 44, 43).

对涂尔干来说，这解释了卢梭著名的反对霍布斯在《利维坦》(1651)中同样著名的论点，即自然状态是一种战争状态(霍布斯1958:107)。首先，在需求与满足需求所需的资源完全成比例的情况下，缺乏发动战争的动机——即未得到满足的需求。第二，霍布斯，卢梭被说服，原始的，不经思考的认同形式，导致怜悯的感觉存在于动物，因此也存在于自然人(1960c: 71ー2; 卢梭1994:45ー6)。涂尔干承认，在《语言的起源》(1781)一书中，卢梭似乎与第二个论点相矛盾，导致一些学者认为他后来的著作更倾向于霍布斯和他的战争状态理论(卢梭1966:32)。但涂尔干反对这种解释，认为后面的段落只是指在自然的怜悯之情(最初仅限于与自然人有关系的那一小部分人)可以延伸到全人类之前所必需的反思。因此，《随笔》充其量只是“对第二篇论述中发展出来的观念的澄清和部分修正。”但如果卢梭因此否认霍布斯将自然状态等同于战争状态，那么他也不认为自然人生活在所谓的“社会”中。直觉和感觉足以满足他的一切需要，而缺乏想象力，他想不出社会能给他带来什么好处。他也没有语言，没有语言就不可能建立社会关系。因此，自然人不是不合群的，而是不合群的; 同样，他也不是不道德的，而是不道德的。卢梭评论道: “多亏了一个非常明智的上帝，他的潜在能力只有在有机会使用的情况下才能得到发展，这样他们就既不会多余，也不会过早繁重，也不会在需要的时候迟到或无用。仅凭本能，人类就拥有了在自然状态下生存所需的一切，而在有教养的理性中，人类拥有了在社会中生存所需的一切”(1960c: 74ー5; 卢梭1994:44,43)。

At this point in the lecture Durkheim appended a note, reminding himself to read the entire passage to his audience: “Very important,’’ the note said, “for it shows that [for Rousseau] social existence is not a diabolical machination but was willed providentially, and that although primitive nature did not necessarily lead to it, it nevertheless contained potentially what would make social existence possible when it became necessary'' (1960c: 75). In one sense, the note emphasized again how critical Durkheim could be of romantic interpretations of the second Discours as a story of man’s Fall, under the influence of a corrupt society, from some primitive state of grace; and in another sense, it indicated the peculiar attraction that Rousseau’s natural man held for Durkheim — i.e., a human nature that contained “potentially” the things that would make society possible (when external conditions called for this particular kind of association), but not so constituted that it would lead, unconditionally and “necessarily,” to societal life. The proper element of contingency thus established, Durkheim turned to Rousseau’s explanation of those factors that gave rise to social life.

在演讲的这一点上，迪尔凯姆附加了一个注释，提醒自己把整个段落读给听众: “非常重要,”注释说，“因为它表明(对卢梭来说)社会存在并不是一个恶魔般的阴谋，而是上帝的旨意，尽管原始的自然并不一定导致它，但它仍然包含了潜在的什么，当它变得必要时，它将使社会存在成为可能”(1960c: 75)。从某种意义上说，这份笔记再次强调了迪尔凯姆对第二部《论语》的浪漫诠释是多么重要，这部作品讲述的是一个堕落的人的故事，在一个腐败的社会的影响下，从某种原始的恩典状态中脱离出来; 从另一种意义上说，它表明了卢梭笔下的自然人对迪尔凯姆的特殊吸引力ーー也就是说，人的本性包含了“潜在的”使社会成为可能的东西(当外部条件需要这种特殊的联系时) ，但是这些东西还没有构成到无条件。由此确立了偶然性的适当要素，涂尔干转向卢梭对产生社会生活的因素的解释。

Societies can come into existence, Durkheim observed, only if man is prevented from remaining in the state of nature. Since the only environment that affects natural man is the physical environment, this is where we must look for the external cause. In the Essai sur I'origine des langues, Rousseau thus asked us to imagine a physical environment in which all human needs were always satisfied: “I cannot see,’’ Rousseau added, “how they would ever have surrendered their primitive freedom and given up their isolated existence, so appropriate to their natural indolence’’ (1960c: 77; Rousseau 1966: 38). By contrast, the obstacles human beings actually encountered in nature began to stimulate their faculties. Intelligence evolved beyond instinct and sensation. New, more complex needs developed, upsetting the primitive balance between desires and resources, and people began to realize the advantage of cooperation in their efforts to satisfy these new needs.

涂尔干观察到，社会只有在人类被禁止保持自然状态的情况下才能存在。因为影响自然人的唯一环境是物理环境，这就是我们必须寻找外部原因的地方。在《语言的起源》一书中，卢梭要求我们想象一个所有人的需求都能得到满足的物质环境: “我看不出来,”卢梭补充道，“他们怎么会放弃原始的自由，放弃孤立的生存，这与他们天生的懒惰如此相称。”(1960c: 77; 卢梭1966:38)。相比之下，人类在大自然中实际遇到的障碍开始激发他们的能力。智力的进化超越了本能和感觉。新的、更加复杂的需求产生了，打破了欲望和资源之间的原始平衡，人们开始意识到合作的优势，努力满足这些新的需求。

This first extension of physical needs thus gave rise to the tendency to form groups; and groups, once formed, aroused social inclinations, the need for civility, the duty of respecting contractual obligations, and even an embryonic ethics. Having emerged from their “embryonic indolence,’’ their minds sharpened by frequent relations, human beings developed agriculture and its derivative arts, giving rise to the first division of labor, the partitioning of land, and the recognition of private property. This possibility of new economic rewards again stimulated new desires, and these desires in turn gave rise to competition and economic inequality. Initially the consequence of differences of circumstance, these differences among people became increasingly permanent in their effects, leading to classes of rich and poor, the weak and the powerful. Pace Hobbes, the state of war was not the origin of society, but rather its effect. Finally, in terms Marx would later appreciate, Rousseau described “the most astute project that has ever occurred to the human mind” — i.e., faced with this state of war, the rich proposed to their fellows that they establish rules of peace and justice to which everyone would conform, and a supreme power to protect and defend all the members of the association — the origin of all laws and governments.[85](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark97)

这种物质需求的第一次延伸导致了形成群体的倾向; 群体一旦形成，就会引起社会的倾向，对文明的需要，尊重契约义务的责任，甚至是一种萌芽的伦理。人类从“懒惰的雏形”中走出来，经过频繁的交往，头脑变得更加敏锐，发展了农业及其衍生的艺术，产生了第一次分工、土地分割和私有财产的认可。这种获得新的经济回报的可能性再次激发了新的欲望，而这些欲望反过来又导致了竞争和经济不平等。最初是环境差异的结果，这些人与人之间的差异在其影响上变得越来越持久，导致了富人和穷人、弱者和强者的阶级。霍布斯，战争状态不是社会的起源，而是它的影响。最后，用马克思后来理解的话来说，卢梭描述了“人类头脑中有史以来最精明的计划”ーー即，面对这种战争状态，富人向他们的同伴提议，他们建立和平与正义的规则，每个人都会遵守，并且拥有保护和捍卫协会所有成员的最高权力ーー所有法律和政府的起源

The resulting civil state, as Durkheim had observed as early as 1886, was not itself “natural,” but rather “artihcial” (1886a: 78—9). But Durkheim would never again describe Rousseau’s notion as “simplistic.” On the contrary, however artificial, the society had emerged naturally from the state of nature. “Although the formula seems self-contradictory,’’ Durkheim admitted, “it expresses Rousseau’s thinking. Let us try to understand it’’ (1960c: 81). In fact, Rousseau’s civil state is artihcial in at least two senses. First, as we have already seen, human beings are not constituted in such a way that they are constrained to enter social life. On the contrary, each individual is self-sufficient in the state of nature. “[T]he social virtues could never have developed unaided,’’ but instead “required the fortuitous aid of several foreign causes which might never have arisen, and without which man would have remained eternally in his primitive state’’ (1960c: 81; Rousseau 1994: 53). Society comes into existence because men see that their needs will be more easily satished through interdependence; but interdependence itself is not rooted in human nature.

涂尔干早在1886年就观察到，由此产生的文明国家本身并不是“自然的”，而是“人为的”(1886a: 78ー9)。但涂尔干再也不会将卢梭的观点描述为“过于简单化”相反，无论多么人为，这个社会都是从自然状态中自然产生的。涂尔干承认: “尽管这个公式似乎自相矛盾，但它表达了卢梭的思想。让我们试着去理解它”(1960c: 81)。事实上，卢梭的公民国家至少在两个意义上是人为的。首先，正如我们已经看到的，人类的组成方式不是被迫进入社会生活的。相反，每个个体在自然状态下都是自给自足的。“社会美德绝不可能在没有帮助的情况下发展起来”，而是“需要一些外来因素的偶然帮助，这些因素可能永远不会出现，没有这些因素，人类就会永远处于原始状态”(1960c: 81; Rousseau 1994:53)。社会之所以存在，是因为人们认识到，通过相互依存，他们的需要将更容易得到满足; 但是，相互依存本身并不植根于人类的本性。

Second, though necessary, this interdependence is not itself sufficient to produce social life. To this original base, Durkheim argued, itself a product of human art, must be added something else that has the same origin. Specihcally, this interdependence must be “regulated and organized in a dehnite way.’’ For according to Rousseau, a society is

其次，尽管这种相互依存是必要的，但它本身并不足以产生社会生活。涂尔干认为，在这个原始的基础上，本身就是人类艺术的产物，必须加上一些具有相同起源的东西。特别是，这种相互依存关系必须“以一种有序的方式进行调节和组织”因为根据卢梭的说法，一个社会

a moral entity having specihc qualities distinct from those of the individual beings which compose it, somewhat as chemical compounds have properties that they owe to none of their elements. If the aggregation resulting from these vague relationships really formed a social body, there would be a kind of common sensorium that would outlive the correspondence of all the parts. Public good and evil would not be merely the sum of individual good and evil, as in a simple aggregation, but would lie in the relation that unites them. It would be greater than that sum, and public well-being

一种道德实体，具有不同于构成它的个体的特殊性质，有点像化合物具有它们不属于任何元素的性质。如果这些模糊的关系所产生的聚合真的形成了一个社会主体，那么就会有一种共同的感觉，它会比所有部分的对应关系更长久。公众的善与恶不仅仅是个人善与恶的总和，就像一个简单的集合，而是存在于将它们联系在一起的关系中。它将比这个数目和公众福祉更大

would not be the result of the happiness of individuals, but rather its source. (1896: 248—9; transl. Durkheim 1960c: 82)

不是个人幸福的结果，而是幸福的源泉

So the mere fact that men “realize that they can help each other and have fallen into the habit of doing so, even when added to the feeling that they all have something in common, that they all belong to the human race,” Durkheim paraphrased Rousseau, “does not form them into a new kind of corporate body with its own specific character and composition, that is, a society” (1960c: 82).

因此，涂尔干引用卢梭的话说，仅仅是人们“意识到他们可以互相帮助，并且已经养成了这样做的习惯，即使再加上他们都有共同点的感觉，即他们都属于人类这一事实，并不能使他们形成一种具有自己特定性格和组成的新的法人团体，也就是一个社会”(1960c: 82)。

It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this idea to Durkheim’s social realism. “This remarkable passage,” Durkheim emphasized to his audience, “proves that Rousseau was keenly aware of the specificity of the social order. He conceived it clearly as an order of facts generically different from purely individual facts. It is a new world superimposed on the purely psychological world.’’ Such a conception was, to Durkheim, “far superior even to that of such recent theorists as Spencer, who think they have grounded society in nature when they have pointed out that man has a vague sympathy for his fellow men, and that it is to his interest to exchange services with them’’ (1960c: 83). Vague sympathies and private interests may make for intermittent contacts and superficial relationships between individuals, but they lack what Rousseau called the “connection between the parts’’ that “constitutes the whole.’’ In short, Rousseau believed that society was a “live, organized body,’’ distinct from and greater than the sum of its parts.[86](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark98)

这一思想对涂尔干的社会现实主义的意义是很难夸大的。涂尔干向听众强调: “这段引人注目的文字，证明卢梭敏锐地意识到社会秩序的特殊性。他清楚地把它看作是一种与纯粹的个别事实不同的事实顺序。这是一个叠加在纯心理世界上的新世界。”对涂尔干来说，这样的概念“甚至远远优于斯宾塞这样的近代理论家，他们认为当他们指出人类对他的同胞有一种模糊的同情，并且与他们交换服务是符合他的利益的时候，他们已经奠定了社会的本质”(1960c: 83)。模糊的同情和私人利益可能导致个人之间断断续续的接触和肤浅的关系，但它们缺乏卢梭所说的“部分之间的联系”，即“构成整体”简而言之，卢梭认为社会是一个“有生命的、有组织的身体”，与其各个部分的总和不同，并且比它们的总和更大。86

But again, this is not to say that society is natural. On the contrary, for Rousseau, only the individual is real and natural, so society must be the product of human reason. “The difference between human art and the work of nature,’’ Rousseau observed, “can be felt in their effects. It is all very well for the citizens to call themselves the limbs of the state; they cannot unite as real limbs unite with the body. It is impossible to prevent each one from having an individual and separate existence and attending to his own needs.’’[87](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark99) Even the family, which Rousseau famously described in Le Contrat social as “[t]he oldest of all societies, and the only natural one,’’ is a natural group only so long as the children are attached to their parents by the need for self-preservation. As soon as the child is able to look after himself, Rousseau had observed, “the natural bond is dissolved” (1968: 50). For Rousseau, in short, “every society is an artihcial entity” (1960c: 84). But what particularly fascinated Durkheim in Le Contrat social was its intermingling of two ideas — i.e., the notion of society as the product of reason, and that of society as an organism — ideas that we normally consider not only distinct but contradictory. Moreover, in Rousseau, each idea seems to imply the other — e.g., it is because society is an organism that it must be a work of art, for nature contains only individuals, and society is clearly superior to the individual.

但是，这并不是说社会是自然的。相反，对卢梭来说，只有个人才是真实和自然的，所以社会必须是人类理性的产物。“人类艺术和自然作品的区别,”卢梭说，“可以从它们的效果中感受到。公民称自己为国家的四肢是完全可以的; 他们不能像真正的四肢与身体一样团结起来。我们不可能阻止每个人独立存在，满足自己的需求。”卢梭在《 Le Contrat 社会》中有一句名言: “家庭是所有社会中最古老的，也是唯一自然的社会。”即使是这样的家庭，也只有在孩子们因为需要自我保存而依附于父母的情况下，才是自然的群体。一旦孩子能够照顾好自己，卢梭就观察到，“自然的纽带就消失了”(1968:50)。对卢梭来说，简而言之，“每个社会都是一个人为的实体”(1960c: 84)。但是，迪尔凯姆在《 Le Contrat 社会》一书中特别感兴趣的是两种观念的混合ーー即社会是理性的产物，社会是有机体的观念ーー我们通常认为这两种观念不仅截然不同，而且相互矛盾。此外，在卢梭，每一种观念似乎都暗示着另一种观念ーー例如，社会是一个有机体，因此它必须是一件艺术品，因为自然界只包含个体，而社会显然优于个体。

For Durkheim, the logical step was obvious — i.e., simply acknowledge that there is something (society) both “real” and “natural,” above and outside of the individual. But “[e]very attempt to widen the circle of natural phenomena,” Durkheim admitted, “requires a great effort, and the mind resorts to all kinds of subterfuges and evasions before resigning itself to so grave a change in its system of ideas.'' But by this time Durkheim had already come to prefer Rousseau’s “subterfuges and evasions” to those of Spencer, who “regards society as a product of nature, a living thing like other living things,’’ but “strips it of its specihc character by reducing it to a mechanical juxtaposition of individuals.” If nothing else, Durkheim observed, Rousseau tried to resolve the problem without abandoning either of the two principles in question — i.e., the individualist principle (which underlies Rousseau’s theory of the state of nature as well as Spencer’s theory of natural law), and the socialist principle which underlies Rousseau’s organic conception of society (1960c: 85).

对涂尔干来说，逻辑上的步骤是显而易见的ーー也就是说，简单地承认在个体之上和之外，存在着某种(社会)既“真实”又“自然”的东西。但涂尔干承认，“扩大自然现象范围的尝试需要付出巨大的努力，而且人的思想在对其思想体系进行如此严重的改变之前，会诉诸各种各样的托词和逃避。”但此时，迪尔凯姆已经开始喜欢卢梭的“诡计和回避”，而不是斯宾塞的那些，斯宾塞“认为社会是自然的产物，像其他生物一样有生命的东西”，但“通过把社会简化为个体的机械并置，剥夺了它的特殊性。”迪尔凯姆观察到，如果没有别的，卢梭试图解决这个问题，而不放弃两个有争议的原则中的任何一个ーー即个人主义原则(卢梭的自然状态理论以及斯宾塞的自然法理论的基础)和社会主义原则(卢梭的社会有机概念的基础)。

Still, for Rousseau, society is not natural thing. Does this mean that society represents the corruption of human nature, an evil consequence of mankind’s fall and degeneration? To understand Rousseau here, Durkheim insists, we must make a distinction. Society as we ®nd it today is, indeed, “a monstrosity that came into being and continues to exist only through a conjunction of accidental and regrettable circumstances” (1960c: 86). As Rousseau had shown in the second Discours, those natural inequalities which derive from differences of age, health, physical strength, mental and spiritual qualities, etc., have been replaced by artificial inequalities — e.g., of wealth, privilege, status, power, etc. — that are contrary to the state of nature. These artificial inequalities initially result from inheritance; but then, stimulated by social evolution, they become stable and legitimate through the establishment of property and law (Rousseau 1994: 84—5). This first violation of the law of nature then leads to a second, which Rousseau described more fully in Le Contrat social and Emile. Briefly, in the state of nature the individual is selfsufficient, depending only on the impersonal and invariable forces of the physical environment. But as society evolves this natural independence is replaced by an artificial, servile interdependence, a society comprised of masters and slaves, in which the first are still more enslaved than the second. So, for Rousseau, there are two kinds of dependence — the dependence on things, which is a phenomenon of nature, and the dependence on other human beings, which is a phenomenon of society. The dependence on things — i.e., necessary, stable, impersonal, etc. — is not an obstacle to freedom; for in nature, our needs are in harmony with our means. We do whatever we desire, because we desire only what is possible. But the dependence on other human beings — willful, unstable, avaricious, deceitful, etc. — produces the mutual corruption and depravity of master and slave (1960c: 87—8).

尽管如此，对卢梭来说，社会并非自然之物。这是否意味着社会代表着人性的堕落，人类堕落和堕落的罪恶后果？迪尔凯姆坚持认为，要在这里理解卢梭，我们必须做出区分。事实上，我们今天所处的社会是“一个只有在偶然和令人遗憾的情况下才会形成并继续存在的怪物”(1960c: 86)。正如卢梭在《论语》第二篇中所指出的那样，那些源于年龄、健康、体力、精神和精神品质等方面差异的自然不平等，已经被人为的不平等所取代ーー例如，财富、特权、地位、权力等方面的不平等，这些不平等与自然状态相反。这些人为的不平等最初源于继承，但随后在社会进化的刺激下，它们通过财产和法律的建立而变得稳定和合法(卢梭1994:84ー5)。这第一个违反自然法则，然后导致第二个，卢梭在 Le Contrat 社会和埃米尔更充分地描述。简而言之，在自然状态下，个体是自给自足的，仅仅依赖于物质环境的非人性的和不变的力量。但是随着社会的发展，这种自然的独立被一种人为的、奴性的相互依存所取代，一个由主人和奴隶组成的社会，在这个社会中，前者仍然比后者更受奴役。所以，对卢梭来说，有两种依赖一种是对事物的依赖，这是一种自然现象，另一种是对他人的依赖，这是一种社会现象。对事物的依赖ーー即必要的、稳定的、客观的等等ーー并不是自由的障碍，因为在自然界中，我们的需要与我们的手段是和谐的。我们想做什么就做什么，因为我们只想要可能的东西。但是对他人的依赖ーー任性的、不稳定的、贪婪的、欺骗的等等ーー导致了主人和奴隶的相互腐败和堕落(1960c: 87-8)。

It is here that Durkheim confronted the passage in Emile that must surely have stopped him cold: “If there is any means of remedying this ill in society,” Rousseau continued

正是在这里，迪尔凯姆直面了在 Emile 的那段经历，这段经历肯定让他停下了脚步，卢梭继续说道: “如果有任何方法可以治愈社会上的这种疾病的话。”

it is to substitute law for man and to arm the general will with a real strength superior to the action of every particular will. If the laws of nations could, like those of nature, have an inflexibility that no human force could ever conquer, dependence on men would then become dependence on things again; in the republic all of the advantages of the natural state would be united with those of the civil state, and freedom which keeps man exempt from vices would be joined to morality which raises him to virtue. (1979: 85)

就是用法律代替人类，用一种比任何特定意志的行动都更强大的实力武装普遍意志。如果国家的法律能像自然法律一样具有人类力量永远无法克服的僵硬性，那么对人的依赖就会再次变成对事物的依赖; 在共和国中，自然国家的所有优势将与文明国家的优势结合在一起，使人免于犯罪的自由将与使人成为美德的道德结合在一起。(1979:85)

In effect, this passage opened the door to the second half of Durkheim’s distinction. If the civil state as it is now violates the law of nature, must the same be true of every civil state? Are human nature and society inherently antithetical? Or might they — by the means suggested by Rousseau — be reconciled?

实际上，这段文字打开了迪尔凯姆区分的后半部分的大门。如果现在的公民国家违反了自然法则，那么每个公民国家也必须如此吗？人性和社会本质上是对立的吗？或者他们——按照卢梭的建议——可以和解？

In the second Discours, Rousseau made it clear that the present defects of the civil state are not necessary. In fact, what distinguishes us from animals is precisely that, with the help of circumstances, we can perfect ourselves — a concern not unlike that found in the Sens lectures (1994: 33—4). In his lectures on Le Contrat social, Durkheim acknowledged that this perfectibility remains dormant in the natural man until it is awakened by circumstances; but still, it is there from the start, and since it exists in nature, the events that result from it cannot be regarded as contrary to nature. And as we have already seen, reason — which is to the social environment what instinct is to the physical environment — was awakened in man by Providence. So society, Durkheim repeated, “is not contrary to the providential order” (1960c: 90, 75; Rousseau 1994: 43). In short, Durkheim rejected all interpretations of Rousseau as a radical pessimist. Society can be organized in manner consistent with human nature, and the purpose of Le Contrat social was to show us how.

在《论语》第二篇中，卢梭明确指出，目前公民国家的缺陷是不必要的。事实上，我们与动物的区别恰恰在于，在环境的帮助下，我们可以完善我们自己ーー这种关注与森斯讲座(1994:33ー4)中发现的关注没有什么不同。在《社会契约论》的演讲中，迪尔凯姆承认，这种完美性在自然人身上一直处于休眠状态，直到它被环境唤醒; 但是，它仍然从一开始就存在，而且由于它存在于自然中，因此由它产生的事件不能被视为与自然相反。正如我们已经看到的，理性ーー对于社会环境来说就像本能对于物质环境一样ーー在人类中被上帝唤醒。因此，涂尔干重申，社会“并不违背天意秩序”(1960c: 90,75; 卢梭1994:43)。简而言之，涂尔干拒绝了所有对卢梭的解读，认为他是一个激进的悲观主义者。社会可以按照符合人性的方式组织起来，《社会契约》的目的就是向我们展示如何组织。

As we’ve seen, man is unable to remain in the state of nature because of external forces that are not themselves natural. To return man to his natural state, therefore, a system of counterforces must thus be established; and since these forces are not given in the state of nature, they must be provided by man. But men cannot create new forces; they can only unite and direct those that already exist. Human beings thus have no other means of preserving themselves than to form, by aggregation, a sum of already existing forces great enough to overcome the resistance. “These they have to bring into play by means of a single motive power,’’ Rousseau observed, “and cause them to act in concert.’’ In short, “once the state of nature has become impossible, a constituted society is the only environment in which man can live’’ (1960c: 92; Rousseau 1968: 59—60). The problem is to organize this new social life in such a way that no violence is done to the law of nature. But in Emile Rousseau made it clear that man’s original condition cannot remain unchanged (1979: 39). Paradoxically, the characteristic features of the state of nature must be transformed and yet simultaneously maintained, assume a new form without ceasing to be what they are. “This they can do,’’ Durkheim observed, “only if social man, though differing profoundly from natural man, maintains the same relation to society as natural man to physical nature’’ (1960c: 93).

正如我们所看到的，人类无法保持自然状态，因为外部力量本身并不是自然的。因此，要使人恢复到自然状态，就必须建立一个反作用力系统; 既然这些作用力不是在自然状态下给予的，那么它们就必须由人提供。但是人类无法创造新的力量，他们只能团结和引导那些已经存在的力量。因此，人类没有其他保存自己的方法，只能通过聚合，形成一个足以克服阻力的现有力量的总和。“他们必须通过单一的动力来发挥作用,”卢梭说，“并使他们协调行动。”简而言之，“一旦自然状态变得不可能，一个组成的社会就是人类生存的唯一环境”(1960c: 92; Rousseau 1968:59ー60)。问题在于如何组织这种新的社会生活，使其不会对自然法则施加暴力。但是在埃米尔 · 卢梭(EmileRousseau)的著作中明确指出，人的原始状态不能保持不变(1979:39)。自相矛盾的是，自然状态的特征必须改变，但同时又要保持，呈现出一种新的形式，而不是停止它们的本来面目。涂尔干说: “只有当社会人，尽管与自然人有着深刻的不同，但与社会保持着同样的关系，就像自然人与自然界的关系一样，他们才能做到这一点。”(1960c: 93)。

How is this possible? Rousseau’s solution, Durkheim observed, is ingenious. In modern society, as we’ve seen, natural equality has been replaced by an artihcial inequality, and dependence on the impersonal forces of nature by the arbitrary, willful relations of master and slave. “If instead of being appropriated by individuals and personalized,’’ Durkheim paraphrases Rousseau, the new force born of the combination of individuals into societies were impersonal and if, in consequence, it transcended all individuals, men would all be equal in regard to it, since none would be in personal command of it. Thus they would depend, not upon each other, but upon a force which by its impersonality would be identical, mutatis mutandis, with the forces of nature. The social environment would affect social man in the same way as the natural environment affects natural man. (1960c: 94; see Rousseau 1979: 85)

这怎么可能？迪尔凯姆观察到，卢梭的解决方案非常巧妙。在现代社会，正如我们所看到的，自然的平等已经被人为的不平等所取代，并且依赖于自然的非人为的力量被武断的，任意的主人和奴隶的关系所取代。涂尔干引用卢梭的话说: “如果不是被个人占有和个性化,”个人与社会的结合所产生的新力量是非个人的，如果因此它超越了所有个人，人们在这方面将是平等的，因为没有人能够亲自指挥它。因此，它们将不再相互依赖，而是依赖于一种力量，这种力量的客观性，经过必要的变通，将与自然的力量完全相同。社会环境对社会人的影响与自然环境对自然人的影响是一样的。(1960c: 94; 参见卢梭1979:85)

Our dependence, in short, would once again be a dependence on things. So it is not enough, Durkheim emphasized, that this new force should simply be superior to all individuals. It must also be based on nature — i.e., “its superiority must not be fictitious but rationally justifiable. Otherwise, it will be precarious and so will its effects. The resulting order will be unstable, lacking the invariability and necessity characteristic of the natural order. It will be unable to endure except by a combination of accidents that may cease to exist at any moment” (1960c: 94-5). So while Rousseau places society outside the realm of nature, it’s not difficult to see why Durkheim considered him a powerful ally for social realism. Although Rousseau’s society is the “artificial” work of human beings, it is created rationally out of natural things — i.e., in accordance with their nature, and thus without doing violence to them. In this way — and only in this way — the social environment becomes a new form of the primitive environment (1960c: 95—6).

简而言之，我们的依赖将再次成为对事物的依赖。因此，涂尔干强调，这种新的力量仅仅优于所有的个体是不够的。它还必须以自然为基础ーー也就是说，“它的优越性不能是虚构的，而必须是合理的。否则，它将岌岌可危，其影响也是如此。由此产生的秩序将是不稳定的，缺乏自然秩序的不变性和必然性特征。它将无法持续，除非一系列的事故随时可能停止存在”(1960c: 94-5)。因此，当卢梭将社会置于自然王国之外时，不难看出为什么涂尔干认为他是社会现实主义的强大盟友。尽管卢梭的社会是人类的“人造”工作，但它是由自然事物理性地创造出来的ーー也就是说，它与自然事物的本质相一致，因此没有对它们施加暴力。这样ーー而且只有这样ーー社会环境成为原始环境的一种新形式(1960年代: 95ー6)。

This argument turns heavily on Rousseau’s distinction between an aggregation and an association. We have already noted that Durkheim placed special emphasis on Rousseau’s insistence that social life presupposes not only “interdependence,” but interdependence that is “regulated and organized in a definite way’’ (1960c: 82). In Rousseau’s critique of Grotius, the significance of this distinction becomes clear. In De Jure Belli ac Pacis (On the Law of War and Peace) (1620—5), Grotius had attempted to provide a rational justification for the right of the strongest, arguing, for example, that if an individual may alienate his freedom, a people might do the same, and that the right of war implies the right of slavery.[88](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark100) In a justifiably famous passage, Rousseau denied that this right could be justi®ed rationally; but even if it could — and this was the more important point for Durkheim - this would still be insufficient to establish social life. For a society, Durkheim paraphrased Rousseau, “is an organized body in which each part is dependent upon the whole, and vice versa. There is no such interdependence in the case of a mob subject to a chief” (1960c: 97-8; Rousseau, 1968: 58). Grotius argued that “a people may give itself to a king.” Rousseau answered that, “before considering the act by which a people submits to a king, we ought to scrutinize the act by which a people become a people, for that act, being necessarily antecedent to the other, is the real foundation of society” (1968: 59).

这个论点在很大程度上转向了卢梭对聚合和关联的区分。我们已经注意到，涂尔干特别强调卢梭坚持认为，社会生活的前提不仅是“相互依存”，而且是相互依存，这是“规范和组织的明确方式”(1960c: 82)。在卢梭对 Grotius 的批判中，这种区别的意义变得清晰起来。在《战争与和平法》(1620ー5)一战争与和平法中，格老秀斯试图为最强者的权利提供一个合理的辩护，例如，他认为，如果一个人可以剥夺他的自由，那么一个民族也可以这样做，而战争的权利意味着奴隶制的权利。在一个合理的著名段落中，卢梭否认这项权利可以被合理地公正，但即使它可以——这是涂尔干更重要的观点——这仍然不足以建立社会生活。对于一个社会，涂尔干解释卢梭，“是一个有组织的机构，其中每个部分都依赖于整体，反之亦然。在暴民服从酋长的情况下，这种相互依赖是不存在的”(1960c: 97-8; Rousseau，1968:58)。格老秀斯认为“一个民族可以把自己献给一个国王。”卢梭回答说，“在考虑一个民族服从国王的行为之前，我们应该仔细检查一个民族成为一个民族的行为，因为这个行为必然先于另一个民族，是社会的真正基础”(1968:59)。

Such an act clearly implies an association, Durkheim emphasized, not simply an aggregation. Rousseau’s problem was thus to find the particular form of association which would “defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before’’ (1960c: 98; Rousseau 1968: 60). This was the problem to which Rousseau’s social contract - the immersion of each individual will into a common, general will - was the solution. And for Durkheim, the most important aspect of this general will was that it had “the impersonal character of natural forces,’’ so that we are “no less free for submitting to it. Not only do we not enslave ourselves by obeying it, but, what is more, it alone can protect us against actual servitude, for if, to make this will possible, we must forgo subjugating others, others must make the same concession. Such is the nature of the equivalence and compensation that re-establish the balance of things” (1960c: 99; emphasis added).

涂尔干强调，这样的行为显然意味着一种联系，而不仅仅是一种聚合。因此，卢梭的问题在于找到一种特殊的联合形式，“用全部的共同力量来保护和捍卫每个联合体的人和财产，在这种联合中，每个联合体在与所有联合体结合的同时，仍然可以独自服从自己，并像以前一样保持自由”(1960c: 98; 卢梭1968:60)。这就是卢梭的社会契约——将每个人的意志融入到一个共同的、普遍的意志中——所解决的问题。对涂尔干来说，这个公共意志最重要的方面是它具有“自然力量的非人格特征”，因此我们“同样可以自由地服从它。”。我们不仅不会因为服从而奴役自己，更重要的是，只有服从才能保护我们免受实际的奴役，因为如果要做到这一点，我们必须放弃征服他人，其他人也必须做出同样的让步。这就是重建事物平衡的等价性和补偿性的本质”(1960c: 99; 强调增加)。

Durkheim’s understanding of the advantages of this kind of selfalienation had changed dramatically since the Sens lectures, when he argued that the compensation proffered by Rousseau - i.e., the rewards one derives from an association of which one is also a member — remains “evidemment immorale” from the standpoint of the individual personality (1884: 465). Durkheim still disagreed with the author of his textbook: “If there is compensation for the alienation of my person, it is not, as Paul Janet has said, because I receive in exchange the personality of others.’’ But when I alienate myself, Durkheim now agreed with Rousseau, it is “the body politic as a corporate body sui generis, and not the individuals” which receives me; and what I receive in return is “the assurance that [I] shall be protected by the full force of the social organism against the individual encroachments of others” (1960c: 100). Durkheim was equally emphatic that the advantages of this exchange are not derived from the greater material force that results from the association of individual wills, but rather from its general, impersonal moral force: “The general will must be respected,” Durkheim insisted, “not because it is stronger but because it is general. If there is to be justice among individuals, there must be something outside them, a being sui generis, which acts as arbiter and determines the law. This something is society, which owes its moral supremacy, not to its physical supremacy, but to its nature, which is superior to that of individuals” (1960c: 103).

迪尔凯姆对这种自我异化优势的理解自森斯讲座以来发生了戏剧性的变化，当时他认为卢梭提供的补偿——也就是说，一个人从一个自己也是其成员的协会中获得的回报——从个人人格的角度来看仍然是“证据不足”(1884:465)。涂尔干仍然不同意他的教科书作者的观点: “如果我的人格异化有补偿的话，那就不是保罗 · 珍妮特所说的那样，因为我得到了他人的人格作为交换。”但是，当我疏远自己时，涂尔干现在同意卢梭的观点，接纳我的是“作为独特的法人团体的政体，而不是个人”; 作为回报，我得到的是“保证(我)将受到社会有机体的全部力量的保护，不受他人的个人侵犯”(1960c: 100)。涂尔干同样强调，这种交换的优势并非来自于个人意志联合所产生的更大的物质力量，而是来自于其普遍的、非个人的道德力量: “普遍意志必须得到尊重,”涂尔干坚持说，“不是因为它更强大，而是因为它是普遍的。如果要在个人之间实现正义，就必须在个人之外存在某种东西，一种独特的存在，它充当仲裁者并决定法律。这就是社会，它的道德至高无上不在于它的物理至高无上，而在于它的本性，它优于个人的本性”(1960c: 103)。

What is this “collective will”? In one sense, Durkheim answers, it is the sum of all particular, individual wills. But it is also more than this - i.e., the “object” to which it is applied must be as “general” as the source from which it comes. In other words, the general will is the consequence of the deliberation concerning the nation itself -i.e., the “common interest” (1960c: 105; see Rousseau 1968: 72-8). What, then, is the “common interest”? Durkheim points out that the phrase is often taken to refer to the interest of the society as a whole, by contrast with the interests of particular citizens. But this, Durkheim emphasizes, is clearly not what Rousseau has in mind. For Rousseau believes that “anything that is useful to all is useful to each.” The common interest is thus the interest of “all individuals in so far as they desire what is most appropriate, not to this or that particular person, but . . . to each citizen.'' Thus the common interest exists as soon as “all continually will the happiness of each one.'' This is a condition, Durkheim observed, that is more egoistic than altruistic, for “there is not a man who does not think of ‘each’ as meaning him, and consider himself in voting for all . . . This proves that equality of rights and the idea of justice which such equality creates originate in the preference each man gives to himself, and accordingly in the very nature of man’’ (1960c: 106; Rousseau 1968: 63). This explains why the general will is best expressed when each individual exercises his share of sovereignty separately from the others - without actual deliberations or the for mation of intermediate groups - so that the differences among individuals cancel each other out, leaving the general will as the arithmetical mean of all individual wills.

什么是“集体意志”？涂尔干回答说，在某种意义上，它是所有特定个人意志的总和。但是它还不止这些——也就是说，应用它的“对象”必须和它的来源一样“一般”。换句话说，普遍意愿是关于国家本身的深思熟虑的结果——也就是，“共同利益”(1960c: 105; 参见卢梭1968:72-8)。那么，什么是“共同利益”？涂尔干指出，这个短语常常被用来指整个社会的利益，与特定公民的利益形成对比。但是涂尔干强调，这显然不是卢梭所想的。因为卢梭相信“任何对所有人有用的东西对每个人都是有用的。”因此，共同利益是“所有个人的利益，只要他们希望什么是最合适的，不是对这个或那个特定的人，而是... ... 对每个公民。”因此，只要“每个人的幸福都会持续下去”，共同利益就存在了涂尔干指出，这是一个利己主义多于利他主义的条件，因为“没有一个人不认为‘每个人’意味着他自己，并认为自己投票给了所有人... ... 这证明，权利平等和这种平等所创造的正义观念源于每个人对自己的偏爱，因此源于人的本性”(1960c: 106; 卢梭1968:63)。这就解释了为什么当每个个体独立于其他个体行使他的主权份额时，一般意志才能得到最好的表达——没有经过实际的审议或组成中间集团——这样个体之间的差异就会相互抵消，使得一般意志成为所有个体意志的算术平均值。

Reflecting on Rousseau’s theory of the general will, Durkheim was disposed to emphasize four things. First, Durkheim reminded his audience, “we discern the horror of all particularism, the unitary conception of society, that was one of the characteristics of the French Revolution” (1960c: 107±8; see, for example, Rousseau 1968: 73). Second, we also “encounter at every turn'' the two, antithetical conceptions in Rousseau's social theory ± i.e., the idea of society as a “mere instrument” for the use of the individual, and the notion of the individual as dependent on a social reality that “far transcends” the multitude of individuals (1960c: 108). Third, and most important, we see again that the authority of the general will lies in its moral rather than material force. “If the community must be obeyed,” Durkheim emphasized, “it is not because it commands, but because it commands the common good” (1960c: 109). The common interest does not exist by virtue of laws or decrees, but rather lies outside of and transcends them; indeed, law is what it ought to be only if it expresses the common interest. Ultimately, the general will lies in the collective unconscious of society, in its habits, customs, and traditions, and in “a persistent disposition” of individuals towards its object ± i.e., the common interest.[89](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark101)

在反思卢梭的公意理论时，涂尔干倾向于强调四点。首先，涂尔干提醒他的听众，“我们看到了所有特殊主义的恐怖，社会的单一概念，这是法国大革命的特点之一”(1960c: 107 ± 8; 参见，例如，卢梭1968:73)。其次，我们还“处处碰到”卢梭社会理论中的两个对立概念，即社会作为个体使用的“纯粹工具”的观念，以及个体依赖于“远远超越”众多个体的社会现实的观念(1960c: 108)。第三，也是最重要的一点，我们再次看到，普遍意志的权威在于它的道德力量，而不是物质力量。“如果必须服从共同体,”涂尔干强调，“不是因为它命令，而是因为它命令公共利益”(1960c: 109)。共同利益不是凭借法律或法令而存在的，而是存在于法律或法令之外并超越法律或法令; 事实上，只有表达了共同利益，法律才是它应该成为的样子。归根结底，一般意志取决于社会的集体潜意识，取决于社会的习惯、风俗和传统，取决于个人对社会目标的“执着态度”，即共同利益。89

Finally, referring to Rousseau's argument that the sovereignty established by the social contract must be indivisible, Durkheim noted that the unity ascribed to it could therefore not be “organic” ± i.e., could not be constituted by a system of diverse, interdependent forces. Rousseau's frequent comparisons of society to “a living body,'' therefore, do not imply that society is a whole made up of distinct parts, working together precisely because they are distinct. On the contrary, his view is that each is “animated by a single, indivisible soul which moves all the parts in the same direction by depriving them, to the same degree, of all independent movement.'' This comparison, Durkheim insisted, “is based on a vitalist and substantialist conception of life and society. The animal body and the social body are both actuated by a vital force whose synergic action produces the cooperation of the parts.'' In sharp contrast to the argument presented by Durkheim in De la division du travail social (1893), Rousseau described the division of labor as “a secondary, derivative phenomenon that does not create the unity of the individual or collective organism, but rather presupposes it.'' Once constituted, the sovereign generates various “organs,” which are emanations of itself, entrusted with implementing the general will. In short, Durkheim concluded, “social solidarity results from the laws that attach the individuals to the group and not to each other. They are linked to each other only because they are linked to the community, that is, alienated within it. Rousseau’s equalitarian individualism did not allow him to take another point of view’’ (1960c: 112).

最后，提到卢梭的论点，即社会契约所确立的主权必须是不可分割的，迪尔凯姆指出，归属于它的统一因此不能是“有机的”± ，也就是说，不能由一个多样的，相互依存的力量系统构成。因此，卢梭经常把社会比作“一个有生命的身体”，这并不意味着社会是由不同的部分组成的整体，它们之所以能够一起工作，恰恰是因为它们是不同的。相反，他的观点是，每个人都是“由一个单一的、不可分割的灵魂驱动的，这个灵魂通过在相同程度上剥夺所有部分的独立运动，使它们朝着同一个方向运动。”涂尔干坚持认为，这种比较“建立在对生命和社会的活力主义和实体主义的概念之上。动物的身体和社会的身体都受到一种生命力的驱动，这种生命力的协同作用产生了各个部分的合作。”与迪尔凯姆在《社会劳动分工》(1893)中提出的观点形成鲜明对比的是，卢梭将劳动分工描述为“一种次要的、衍生的现象，它不能创造个体或集体有机体的统一，而是预先假定它。”君主一旦成立，就会产生各种各样的“机关”，这些“机关”是君主自身的产物，被赋予执行公意的任务。简而言之，迪尔凯姆总结道，“社会团结源于将个人附加于群体而不是彼此之间的法律。他们之所以相互联系，仅仅是因为他们与社会相联系，也就是说，他们在社会中被疏远了。卢梭的平等主义个人主义不允许他采取另一种观点”(1960c: 112)。

Durkheim’s ®nal lecture thus stressed the “perfect continuity” between the second Discours and Le Contrat social:

因此，涂尔干的最后一次演讲强调了第二次论述和《契约社会》之间的“完美连续性”:

The state of nature, as described in the former, is a kind of peaceful anarchy in which individuals, independent of each other and without ties between them, depend only upon the abstract force of nature. In the civil state, as viewed by Rousseau, the situation is the same, though in a different form. The individuals are unconnected with each other; there is a minimum of personal relation between them, but they are dependent upon a new force, which is superimposed on the natural forces but has the same generality and necessity, namely, the general will. In the state of nature, man submits voluntarily to the natural forces and spontaneously takes the direction they impose because he feels instinctively that this is to his advantage and that there is nothing better for him to do. His action coincides with his will. In the civil state, he submits just as freely to the general will because it is of his own making and because in obeying it he is obeying himself. (1960c: 135)

前者所描述的自然状态是一种和平的无政府状态，在这种无政府状态中，个体彼此独立，彼此之间没有联系，只依赖于自然的抽象力量。在卢梭看来，公民国家的情况是一样的，只是形式不同。个体彼此之间没有联系; 他们之间只有最低限度的个人关系，但他们依赖于一种新的力量，这种力量叠加在自然力量之上，但具有相同的普遍性和必然性，即一般意志。在自然状态下，人类自愿地服从自然力量，并自发地采取它们强加的方向，因为他本能地感到这对他有利，而且没有什么更好的事情可以让他去做。他的行动与他的意愿相一致。在公民国家，他同样自由地服从一般意志，因为这是他自己造成的，因为服从这个意志就是服从他自己。(1960c: 135)

From Hobbes to Montesquieu to Rousseau, Durkheim summarized for his audience, “we observe an increasing effort to root the social being in nature. But therein,’’ he added, “lies the weakness of [Rousseau’s] system.’’ Durkheim emphasized again that, for Rousseau, society is not contrary to the social order; but still, “it has so little in common with nature that one wonders how it is possible . . . So unstable is [society’s] foundation in the nature of things,’’ Durkheim concluded, “that it cannot but appear to us as a tottering structure whose delicate balance can be established and maintained only by an almost miraculous conjunction of circumstances’’ (1960c: 137-8).

从霍布斯到孟德斯鸠再到卢梭，迪尔凯姆向他的听众总结道: “我们观察到，人们越来越努力地将社会存在植根于自然之中。但是,”他补充道，“这正是(卢梭的)体系的弱点所在。”涂尔干再次强调，对于卢梭来说，社会并不违背社会秩序; 但是，“它与自然的共同点如此之少，以至于人们怀疑它怎么可能... ... (社会)在事物本质中的基础如此不稳定,”涂尔干总结道，“以至于在我们看来，它只能是一个摇摇欲坠的结构，其微妙的平衡只有通过几乎奇迹般的环境连接才能建立和维持”(1960c: 137-8)。

Durkheim’s lecture-course on Rousseau's educational theory was given on two occasions after he settled in Paris in 1902. As noted in chapter 2 (esp. pp. 45-111), education was a life-long interest and concern of Durkheim’s and, as his note to Xavier Leon indicates, he considered the themes of Le Contrat social and Emile to be “closely linked.”[90](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark102) In Le Contrat social, for example, Rousseau’s goal had been to conceive a civil state that would suit man “in general’’ — i.e., a plan based on the essential elements of human nature, regardless of its particular circumstances. Similarly, Emile “does not enquire which form of education is appropriate to a particular country or epoch,’’ Durkheim observed, for “[t]hese are chance conditions which have no bearing on the fundamental nature of things and should be disregarded” (1979: 164). Neither did Rousseau ask what kind of education is most appropriate for a specific occupation: “It matters little to me,’’ he said, “whether my pupil is intended for the army, the church or the law. Before his parents chose a calling for him nature called him to be a man. Life is the trade I would teach him.’’[91](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark103) Again and again, Durkheim observed, “the need is to set aside the accidental, the variable and to get at the essential, the rock upon which human reality rests’’ (1979: 166).

涂尔干在1902年定居巴黎后，曾两次举办关于卢梭教育理论的讲座。如第二章所述(特别是。第45-111页) ，教育是迪尔凯姆一生的兴趣和关注，正如他在给泽维尔 · 莱昂的笔记中指出的那样，他认为《社会契约论》的主题和埃米尔是“紧密联系在一起的”例如，在 Le Contrat 社会学中，卢梭的目标是构建一个“总体上”适合人类的公民国家ーー即一个基于人性基本要素的计划，而不管其具体情况如何。同样，埃米尔“并不询问哪种教育形式适合某个特定的国家或时代,”迪尔凯姆评论道，因为“这些都是与事物的基本性质无关的偶然条件，应该被忽视”(1979:164)。卢梭也没有问什么样的教育最适合特定的职业: “对我来说没什么关系,”他说，“我的学生是为军队、教会还是法律服务。在他的父母选择召唤他之前，大自然要求他成为一个男人。生活就是我教给他的职业。”涂尔干一次又一次地观察到，“我们需要把偶然的、可变的事物放在一边，去抓住人类现实赖以生存的本质——那块岩石”(1979:166)。

In addition to this preference for the general rather than the particular, Durkheim emphasized Rousseau’s insistence on the natural goodness of the child and the adult's propensity for evil: “God makes all things good,’’ Rousseau observed, “man meddles with them and they become evil’’ (1911: 5; Durkheim 1979: 166). But Rousseau is not telling us to be less meddlesome, to adopt a laisser faire policy with regard to the child’s education. For, by nature, the child is also weak and, in particular, lacks the “harmony between desires and strength'' which Rousseau had discussed in the second Discours. Left in his natural, independent condition, the child would develop such a harmony, learning from things; but this alone would not prepare the child to live in society, to become a citizen. “Good social institutions,’’ Durkheim thus quoted Rousseau, “are those best ®tted to make a man unnatural, to exchange his independence for dependence, to merge the unit in the group, so that he no longer regards himself as one, but as a part of the whole, and is only conscious of the common life'' (1911: 7; Durkheim 1979: 167). In short, education must “transform’’ or “denature’’ the natural child.

除了这种对一般而不是特殊的偏好，迪尔凯姆强调卢梭坚持孩子的自然善良和成年人的邪恶倾向: “上帝使一切好,”卢梭观察，“人干预他们，他们成为邪恶”(1911:5; 迪尔凯姆1979:166)。但卢梭并不是要我们少管闲事，对孩子的教育采取自由放任的政策。因为，从本质上讲，这个孩子也是软弱的，尤其是缺乏卢梭在第二篇论文中所讨论的“欲望与力量之间的和谐”。如果让孩子处于自然、独立的状态，他们就会发展出这样的和谐，从事物中学习; 但是仅仅这样还不足以让孩子准备好生活在社会中，成为一个公民。迪尔凯姆这样引用卢梭的话说: “好的社会制度，是那些最能使人变得不自然，用独立换取依赖，把单位合并到集体中的制度，这样他就不再认为自己是一个整体，而是作为整体的一部分，并且只意识到普通的生活。”(1911:7; 迪尔凯姆1979:167)。简而言之，教育必须“改造”或“变性”自然的孩子。

How is the educator to do this? “The mere limitation of our desires is not enough,’’ Rousseau observed, “for if [our desires] were less than our powers, part of our faculties would be idle, and we should not enjoy our whole being; neither is the mere extension of our powers enough, for if our desires were also increased we should only be the more miserable'' (1911: 44; Durkheim 1979: 167—8). Instead, happiness is to be found in decreasing the difference between our desires and our powers, thus establishing a perfect equilibrium between the power and the will. Only then, Rousseau added, “when all its forces are employed, will the soul be at rest and man will find himself in his true position.'' This is the condition in which nature — “who does everything for the best'' — has placed the child from the start: “It is only in this primitive condition,'' Rousseau observed, “that we find the equilibrium between desire and power, and then alone man is not unhappy'' (1911: 44; Durkheim 1979: 168). So we should educate the child in accordance with his nature. In short, education is to become scientihc by basing itself on the objective study of a given reality, thus providing itself with a guarantee against subjective impressions. Before Rousseau, educational theory had conveyed only feelings, aspirations, reasons masquerading as arguments. ''Nothing to study,' Durkheim emphasized, but in Emile, “the idea is put forward that to be normal, education must reproduce a given model in reality. Not a construct, since there is something to find out, Refer to the given fact, placed beyond the realm of fantasy. Incipient science,'' Durkheim applauded Rousseau, is “[s]trongly a priori. Yet, in principle, an objective standard'' (1979: 170).

教育工作者该怎么做呢？“仅仅限制我们的欲望是不够的,”卢梭说，“因为如果(我们的欲望)少于我们的力量，我们的部分能力就会闲置，我们就不应该享受我们的整个存在; 仅仅扩展我们的力量也是不够的，因为如果我们的欲望也增加了，我们只会变得更加悲惨”(1911:44; 涂尔干1979:167ー8)。相反，幸福是在减少我们的欲望和力量之间的差异，从而在力量和意志之间建立一个完美的平衡。只有这样，卢梭补充说，“当所有的力量都被使用时，灵魂才会安息，人才会发现自己处于真正的位置。”这就是大自然ーー“凡事都为了最好的人”ーー从一开始就把孩子置于的状态: “只有在这种原始状态下,”卢梭观察到，“我们才能找到欲望和权力之间的平衡，然后只有人类才不会不快乐”(1911:44; 涂尔干1979:168)。所以我们应该根据孩子的性格来教育他。简而言之，教育要成为科学，必须以客观地研究特定的现实为基础，从而为自己提供一个避免主观印象的保证。在卢梭之前，教育理论只传达情感、愿望和伪装成论证的理由。迪尔凯姆强调说: “没有什么可研究的，但是在 Emile，人们提出这样的观点: 要想成为正常人，教育必须在现实中再现给定的模式。不是一个构想，因为有东西要发现，指的是给定的事实，置于幻想的领域之外。“早期科学,”涂尔干为卢梭鼓掌，是一种先验。然而，在原则上，一个客观的标准”(1979:170)。

Studied in this way, nature teaches us that there a certain number of basic needs — e.g., the animal's need to breathe, to move about, to exercise, etc. — that can be satis®ed simply by allowing these needs to develop freely. Eventually, however, nature imposes limits, and the animal confronts ''the yoke of necessity, under which every ®nite being must bow'' (Rousseau 1911: 55; Durkheim 1979: 171). Repeated, this confrontation leads to adaptation, that ''harmony between needs and means, powers and desires,'' that is ''the true strength, the true power, the condition of true happiness.'' Such harmony, however, assumes that the animal ''should not continue to develop endlessly and that he should stop or be stopped. The idea of a limit, of an impassable limit.'' This kind of harmony or equilibrium is achieved naturally in animals, and everywhere throughout the natural world, which suggests that it is a part of our destiny. But among human beings, it is far more dif®cult to achieve, because we possess “superfluous, potential powers'' and, in particular, imagination. “The world of reality has its bounds,' Durkheim wrote in his lecture notes, “the world of imagination is boundless' (1979: 172; Rousseau 1911: 45). Imagination expands our bounds of possibility, Rousseau observed,

通过这种方式研究，大自然告诉我们，有一定数量的基本需求ーー例如，动物需要呼吸、活动、锻炼等ーー只要允许这些需求自由发展，就能得到满足。然而，最终，自然施加了限制，动物面临“必然的枷锁，每个夜晚都必须鞠躬”(卢梭1911:55; 涂尔干1979:171)。重复一遍，这种对抗导致适应，即“需求与手段、权力与欲望之间的和谐”，即“真正的力量、真正的权力、真正幸福的条件”然而，这种和谐是假定动物“不应该继续无止境地发展下去，它应该停下来或者被阻止。”。一个极限的想法，一个不可逾越的极限。”这种和谐或平衡是在动物身上自然形成的，在自然界的任何地方都是如此，这表明这是我们命运的一部分。但是对于人类来说，要达到这个目标要困难得多，因为我们拥有“多余的、潜在的力量”，特别是想象力。涂尔干在他的演讲笔记中写道: “现实的世界有它的界限，想象的世界是无限的”(1979:172; 卢梭1911:45)。卢梭观察到，想象力拓展了我们的可能性范围,

and therefore stimulates and feeds our desires by the hope of satisfying them. But the object which seemed within our grasp flies quicker than we can follow; when we think we have grasped it, it transforms itself and is again far ahead of us . . . Thus we exhaust our strength, yet never reach our goal, and the nearer we are to pleasure, the further we are from happiness. (1911: 44; Durkheim 1979: 173)

因此，通过满足我们的欲望来刺激和满足我们的欲望。但似乎在我们掌握之中的东西飞得比我们跟得还快; 当我们认为我们已经掌握了它，它就会改变自己，再次遥遥领先于我们... ... 因此我们耗尽了我们的力量，但从未达到我们的目标，我们离快乐越近，我们离幸福就越远。(1911:44; 涂尔干1979:173)

“There is no longer anything which can satisfy us,” Durkheim agreed. “We can only invent. But then, whatever we do, we are limited. The world does not yield to us. Hence a feeling of pained surprise” (1979: 173).

“再也没有什么能让我们满意了,”迪尔凯姆表示同意。“我们只能发明。但是，无论我们做什么，我们都是有限的。世界不会向我们屈服。因此，一种痛苦的惊讶的感觉”(1979:173)。

Durkheim recognized that here he was dealing with a notion of freedom very different from the liberal, individualistic conception advanced in Mill’s On Liberty (1859). On the contrary, as he stressed in his notes, “we are dealing . . . with a completely different sort offreedom. Freedom which is contained, which is limited. The notion of limitation is essential to it. Strict discipline.' And Durkheim’s notes also suggest that he grasped the fundamental principle that underlay this notion of freedom: “The basis of this idea,' he stressed to his audience, is less a rational idea than an obscure feeling: the feeling that “[w]hat is necessary has a reason. That which has a reason cannot be bad. Even the necessity of death . . . Obscure and scarcely rational feeling of the rightness of what is necessary’’ (1979: 174; see Rousseau 1911: 131, 133). So nature teaches that happiness is possible only through the recognition and acceptance of what is necessary. For education, this meant that we should not command the child to obey, for a command is an expression of will and, as such, is arbitrary and contingent. In addition, a command is typically based upon opinion, which “does not express things as they are. It denatures them. It is an artihcial thing.’’ And least of all should we moralize, for “morality is discerned by reason, and the child has no reason’’ (1979: 175). The child “must never act from obedience,’’ Rousseau observes, “but from necessity. The very words obey and command will be excluded from his vocabulary, still more so those of duty and obligation; but the words strength, necessity, weakness, and constraint must have a large place in it’’ (1911: 53; Durkheim 1979: 177).

涂尔干认识到，他在这里所处理的自由概念与密尔在《论自由》(1859)中提出的自由主义、个人主义概念大不相同。相反，正如他在笔记中强调的那样，“我们面对的是... ... 一种完全不同的自由。自由是被包含的，是有限的。限制的概念对它是必不可少的。严格的纪律。迪尔凯姆的笔记还表明，他抓住了支撑这种自由观念的基本原则: “这种观念的基础,”他向听众强调，与其说是一种理性的想法，不如说是一种模糊的感觉: “(w)什么是必要的感觉是有原因的。有理由的事情不可能是坏事。甚至死亡的必要性... ... 对必要性的正确性的模糊和几乎没有理性的感觉”(1979:174; 参见卢梭1911:131,133)。因此，大自然教导我们，只有通过认识和接受必要的东西，幸福才是可能的。对于教育而言，这意味着我们不应该命令孩子服从，因为命令是意志的表达，因此，是任意和偶然的。此外，命令通常基于意见，意见“不能表达事物本来的样子。会使它们变性。这是一种人造的东西。”最重要的是，我们应该说教，因为“道德是由理性决定的，而孩子没有理性”(1979:175)。孩子“决不能出于顺从而行动,”卢梭观察到，“而是出于必要。他的词汇中不包括服从和命令，更不包括责任和义务; 但是力量、必要性、软弱和约束这些词必须在其中占有很大的位置。”。

Where, Durkheim then asks, are we to find the power to stop and restrain the child? Rousseau's answer could hardly be more clear: in things. Durkheim's notes emphasize here that things “act from necessity; impersonally. Do not obey any individual will. Thus it is from them alone that this early education must emanate. The power of things' (1979: 178). Early in his life, Rousseau insisted, the child should “hnd upon his proud neck, the heavy yoke which nature has imposed upon us, the heavy yoke of necessity, under which every finite being must bow. Let him ®nd this necessity in things, not in the caprices of man; let the curb be force, not authority' (1911: 55; Durkheim 1979: 178). Authority is thus excluded only from the child's early education, Durkheim observes, for it will play a large part in later life; but when it does, “it will have to be modelled on the action of things, that is to say on physical necessity. Necessity [is] the prototype of obligation” (1979: 179).

迪尔凯姆接着问，我们在哪里才能找到阻止和约束这个孩子的力量？卢梭的答案再清楚不过了: 在物质方面。涂尔干的笔记在这里强调，事物“出于必然，客观地行动。不要服从任何个人的意愿。因此，这种早期教育必须由他们自己发起。万物的力量》(1979:178)。卢梭坚持认为，在孩子的早期，他应该“把自己骄傲的脖子，大自然强加给我们的沉重枷锁，必然的沉重枷锁，每一个有限的生命都必须在其下俯首称臣。”。让他和这种必要性存在于事物中，而不存在于人的反复无常之中; 让约束力成为力量，而不是权威”(1911:55; 涂尔干1979:178)。因此，权威只能被排除在孩子的早期教育之外，涂尔干观察到，因为它将在以后的生活中发挥很大的作用; 但是当权威发挥作用时，“它将不得不以事物的行为为模型，也就是说，以物质的必要性为模型。“必要性是义务的原型”(1979:179)。

At this point in his lecture, Durkheim compared Rousseau with Spencer, noting that both reject artihcial punishment in favor of the child's learning through the natural consequences of his actions. But Spencer's more utilitarian position looked to self-interest as the criterion for the judgment of these consequences, and rejected all notions of constraint or discipline. In Rousseau, by contrast, an active sentiment of self-discipline and impersonal necessity was always present. Rousseau was thus more appropriately compared to Kant — on whom he was a great influence — and Rousseau's “impersonal things'' with Kant's notion of the imperative, rational moral law (1979: 179). The child must thus live surrounded by things, Durkheim continued, and this is consistent with his nature. “Act in such a way,'' Durkheim quoted Rousseau, “that while he only notices external objects his ideas are con®ned to sensations; let him only see the physical world around him'' (1911: 53; Durkheim 1979: 179). But this is not to say that the child should have no master. The teacher is to exert no direct action, but exercises considerable power by acting indirectly, behind and through things. “The limits of the possible and the impossible are alike unknown to [the child],'' Rousseau explained, “so they can be extended or contracted around him at your will. Without a murmur, he is restrained, urged on, held back, by the hands of necessity alone; he is made adaptable and teachable by the mere force of things, without any chance for vice to spring up in him'' (1911: 56; Durkheim 1979: 180). Let the child “always think he is master while you are really master,'' Rousseau adds, for “[t]here is no subjection so complete as that which preserves the forms of freedom; it is thus that the will itself is taken captive” (1911: 84; Durkheim 1979: 180).

在讲座的这一点上，涂尔干将卢梭与斯宾塞进行了比较，指出两者都反对人为的惩罚，而支持孩子通过其行为的自然后果来学习。但是斯宾塞更加功利主义的立场把自身利益作为判断这些后果的标准，并且拒绝了所有约束或纪律的概念。相比之下，在卢梭，自律和客观需要的积极情绪始终存在。因此，卢梭更适合与康德(他对康德产生了巨大的影响)以及卢梭的“非个人化的东西”与康德的命令理性道德法则(1979:179)进行比较。因此，孩子必须生活在物质的包围之中，涂尔干继续说道，这与他的天性是一致的。迪尔凯姆引用卢梭的话说: “以这样的方式行事，当他只注意外部事物时，他的思想被感觉蒙蔽了; 让他只看到他周围的物质世界”(1911:53; 迪尔凯姆1979:179)。但这并不是说孩子不应该有主人。教师不是直接行动，而是通过间接、幕后和通过事物来行使相当大的权力。“可能性和不可能性的界限对于孩子来说都是未知的,”卢梭解释道，“所以它们可以在你的意愿下延伸或缩小在他周围。”。没有一句低语，他被束缚，被鼓励，被抑制，仅仅是出于需要; 他仅仅通过事物的力量来适应和教导，没有任何机会让罪恶在他身上出现”(1911:56; 涂尔干1979:180)。让孩子“总是认为他是主人，而你才是真正的主人,”卢梭补充道，因为“这里没有比保留自由形式更完整的臣服; 这样，意志本身就被俘虏了”(1911:84; 涂尔干1979:180)。

This is what Rousseau meant, Durkheim explained to his students, when he said that early education should be entirely negative — i.e., it should exclude the teacher from doing anything, except indirectly ± and thus it should contain no positive moral content, opinion, or information. “Before the age of reason,” Rousseau emphasizes, “it is impossible to form any idea of moral being or social relations; so avoid, as far as may be, the use of words which express these ideas, lest the child at an early age should attach wrong ideas to him, ideas which you cannot or will not destroy when he is older” (1911: 53; Durkheim 1979: 186). This early, “negative” education by things, however, lays the foundation for later, moral education. For it is from such a negative education that the “sentiment of absolute necessity” derives. In later education, of course, this sentiment will be modihed, and take on a new form; but it must hrst exist if it is to later be transformed. The action of things, as Durkheim made clear in an earlier draft of the lecture, “has a positive effect. It pre-forms. It constitutes the principal part of education. Why? Because man in the natural state is the basis of moral and social man, and because everything depends on the foundations. The one is modelled on the other.”[92](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark104) This, Durkheim insisted, “is the source of our sense of the real” (1979: 188). Rousseau recognized, of course, that things are instructive because they are “striking,” “simply and forcefully perceived,” provide a means of “avoiding abstraction,” are “useful and complementary,'' and so on. But Rousseau also understood that they are instructive for “a deeper reason” ± i.e., it is “only from them that moral action can come.'' For the will is capricious, and leads to immorality, while moral law is “a wall of brass which stops man.” The natural education of the child leads to the “feeling of necessity, of the resistance of things' which, superior to the will, prepare the child for later moral life. Here again we see the principle so important in both L’Evolution pedagogique and L’Education morale — i.e., that the study of science (including social science) is morally edifying (see Durkheim 1977: 213—15).

这就是卢梭的意思，涂尔干向他的学生解释说，当他说早期教育应该是完全消极的，也就是说，它应该排除教师做任何事情，除了间接 ± ，因此它不应该包含积极的道德内容，意见或信息。卢梭强调: “在理性时代之前，不可能形成任何关于道德存在或社会关系的观念; 因此，尽可能避免使用表达这些观念的词语，以免孩子在幼年时期就把错误的观念附加到他身上，这些观念你不能或不会在他长大后破坏掉。”(1911:53; 涂尔干1979:186)。然而，这种早期的“消极”的物质教育为后来的道德教育奠定了基础。因为“绝对必要的感情”正是从这种消极的教育中衍生出来的。当然，在以后的教育中，这种情感会被改变，并采取一种新的形式; 但是，如果它要在以后被改变，它必须首先存在。事物的行为，正如迪尔凯姆在早期的演讲草稿中明确指出的那样，“具有积极的影响。它预先形成。它构成了教育的主体。为什么？因为自然状态下的人是道德和社会人的基础，因为一切都取决于基础。一个是以另一个为模板的。”涂尔干坚持认为，这“是我们对真实的感觉的来源”(1979:188)。当然，卢梭承认事物是有教育意义的，因为它们是“引人注目的”，“简单而有力的感知”，提供了一种“避免抽象”的手段，是“有用的和互补的”，等等。但卢梭也明白，他们是有益的“更深层次的原因”± ，也就是说，它是“只有从他们，道德行动可以来。”因为意志是反复无常的，会导致不道德，而道德律法是“阻止人的铜墙铁壁”儿童的自然教育导致了“必然的感觉，对事物的抵抗”，这种感觉优于意志，使儿童为以后的道德生活做好准备。在这里，我们再次看到了进化教育学和教育士气中如此重要的原则ーー也就是说，科学(包括社会科学)的研究在道德上是有益的(见涂尔干1977:213ー15)。

SOCIAL REALISM AS SECULAR THEODICY

作为世俗神学的社会现实主义

The notes of Durkheim’s lectures on both Le Contrat social and Emile thus bear eloquent testimony to the depth and extent of his interest in Rousseau’s work. Recalling Durkheim’s often hostile treatment of Rousseau as late as Les Regies de la methode sociologique (1895), however, one is led to ask at what point Rousseau’s ideas began to be assimilated into Durkheim’s own theoretical works. From the notes of the lecture-course on Le Contrat social — given twice before Durkheim left Bordeaux for Paris in 1902 — we know that Durkheim relied heavily on the 1896 edition produced by Edmond Dreyfus-Brisac, then editor-in-chief of the Revue international de l'enseignement. This suggests that the hrst place to look is Le Suicide (1897), where Durkheim took up in “a concrete and specihc form’’ those methodological problems already examined in Les Regles. Among these was the principle that social facts must be studied as things — i.e., as realities external to the individual. There is no principle for which we have received more criticism, Durkheim admitted, “but none is more fundamental” (1951: 37—8). For sociology to be possible, “it must above all have an object all its own. It must take cognizance of a reality which is not in the domain of other sciences. But if no reality exists outside of individual consciousness,’’ he added, “it wholly lacks any material of its own. In that case, the only possible subject of observation is the mental states of the individual, since nothing else exists. That, however, is the held of psychology” (1951: 38). The attempt to provide sociology with a foundation in nature would thus founder on the bedrock of individual psychology, depriving sociology of “the only object proper to it,’’ leaving them with “only a borrowed existence.’’ But “from every page’’ of Le Suicide, Durkheim announced, there would emerge the contrary idea — i.e., the impression that the individual is dominated by a moral reality greater than himself: namely, collective reality’’ (1951: 38).

迪尔凯姆关于《社会契约论》和《埃米尔》的演讲笔记因此雄辩地证明了他对卢梭作品兴趣的深度和广度。然而，回想起涂尔干在《社会学方法论的规则》(1895)时对卢梭的敌对态度，人们不禁要问，从什么时候起，卢梭的思想开始被涂尔干自己的理论作品所吸收。从迪尔凯姆1902年离开波尔多前往巴黎之前两次讲授 Le Contrat 社会的课程笔记中，我们知道迪尔凯姆严重依赖当时《国际教育评论》(Revue international de l’enseignement)主编埃德蒙德•德雷福斯-布里萨克(Edmond Dreyfus-Brisac)编写的1896年版本。这表明，人类历史学家组织应该关注的是《自杀》(1897) ，迪尔凯姆在这本书中以“一种具体而特殊的形式”探讨了 Les Regles 已经研究过的方法论问题。其中一个原则是，社会事实必须作为事物来研究ーー也就是说，作为个人外部的现实。涂尔干承认，没有任何原则能使我们受到更多的批评，“但没有任何原则比这更基本”(1951:37ー8)。为了使社会学成为可能，“它首先必须有一个完全属于自己的对象。它必须认识到一个不属于其他科学领域的现实。但是如果没有现实存在于个人意识之外,”他补充说，“它完全缺乏自身的任何材料。在这种情况下，唯一可能的观察对象是个体的精神状态，因为没有其他东西存在。然而，这是心理学所持有的”(1951:38)。为社会学提供一个自然基础的尝试因此会在个体心理学的基础上失败，剥夺了社会学“唯一适合它的对象”，留给它们“只是借来的存在”但是迪尔凯姆宣称，《自杀》的“每一页”都会出现相反的观点ーー即个体被一个比他自己更强大的道德现实所支配的印象: 即集体现实”(1951:38)。

The pages from which this idea emerged most powerfully were those devoted to the discussion of anomie. In book 2, chapter 5, Durkheim turned his attention to the curious fact that suicide rates increase, not just during economic crises, but more specihcally during “crises of prosperity’’ — e.g., situations in which real income is increasing, or people are experiencing greater economic comfort, vitality, etc. “Every disturbance of equilibrium,’’ Durkheim observed, “even though it achieves greater comfort and a heightening of general vitality, is an impulse to voluntary death. Wherever serious readjustments take place in the social order, whether or not due to a sudden growth or to an unexpected catastrophe, men are more inclined to self-destruction . . . How can something considered generally to improve existence,” Durkheim openly wondered, “serve to detach men from it?” Unmistakably, Durkheim’s answer was drawn from the second Discours and Emile. “No living being,’’ Durkheim began, “can be happy or even exist unless his needs are sufficiently proportioned to his means.’’ In the case of animals, which — like Rousseau’s natural man — depend on purely material conditions, this equilibrium between needs and means is established and maintained automatically, for the limits of animal instincts and environmental resources are “fundamental to the constitution of the existence in question.’’ In particular, the animal lacks any powers of reflection that would lead it to imagine any ends other than those implicit in its physical nature. Most human needs, however, depend not on the body, but on the imagination; and thus “beyond the indispensable minimum which satis®es nature when instinctive, a more awakened reflection suggests better conditions, seemingly desirable ends craving fulfillment” (1951: 246—7).

这种观点最有力地来自于那些专门讨论失范现象的文章。在第二卷第五章中，涂尔干将他的注意力转向了一个奇怪的事实: 自杀率增加，不仅仅是在经济危机期间，而且更具体地说是在“繁荣危机”期间ーー例如，在实际收入增加的情况下，或者人们正在经历更大的经济舒适度、活力等等。涂尔干观察到，“每一种平衡的紊乱，即使它实现了更大的舒适度和普遍活力的提高，也是一种自愿死亡的冲动。无论社会秩序在哪里发生重大的调整，无论是由于突然的增长还是由于意外的灾难，人们都更倾向于自我毁灭... ... 一般被认为可以改善生存的东西，怎么能让人们脱离它呢?”涂尔干公开质疑道毫无疑问，涂尔干的答案来自于第二部《论语》和《埃米尔》。“没有任何生物,”迪尔凯姆开始说，“除非他的需求与他的收入相称，否则他不可能幸福，甚至不可能存在。”就动物而言，就像卢梭笔下的自然人一样，纯粹依赖于物质条件，需求和手段之间的这种平衡是自动建立和维持的，因为动物本能和环境资源的限制是“有关存在构成的基础”尤其是，这种动物缺乏任何能够引导它想象除了它的物理本性所隐含的目的之外的反射能力。然而，大多数人类的需要，不是依赖于身体，而是依赖于想象力; 因此，“在本能满足自然的不可或缺的最低限度之外，一个更觉醒的反思意味着更好的条件，看似理想的结局渴望实现”(1951:246ー7)。

Admitting these differences between human beings and lower animals, Durkheim asked, how can we determine the quantity of well-being, comfort, or luxury to be “legitimately” craved by a human being? Here Durkheim was careful to point out that there is nothing in the organic or psychological constitution of human beings that might set natural limits to these needs and desires, an assertion that he supported by pointing to their constant increase, despite more and more complete satisfaction, throughout human history, as well as their extreme variability across socio-economic classes. “It is not human nature,’’ Durkheim thus insisted, “which can assign the variable limits necessary to our needs. They are thus unlimited so far as they depend on the individual alone. Irrespective of any external regulatory force, our capacity for feeling is in itself an insatiable and bottomless abyss’’ (1951: 247). And no less than Rousseau, Durkheim considered this capacity as a sign of human degeneration and a source of extreme human misery: “Unlimited desires are insatiable by definition,” he observed, “and insatiability is rightly considered a sign of morbidity. Being unlimited, they constantly and infinitely surpass the means at their command; they cannot be quenched . . . To pursue a goal which is by dehnition unattainable is to condemn oneself to a state of perpetual unhappiness” (1951: 247-8).

迪尔凯姆承认人类和低等动物之间的这些差异，他问道，我们如何确定一个人“合理”渴望的幸福、舒适或奢侈的数量？涂尔干在这里谨慎地指出，在人类的有机或心理构成中，没有任何东西可能会对这些需求和欲望设置自然的限制，他指出，在整个人类历史中，尽管越来越完全的满足，这些需求和欲望却在不断增加，以及它们在社会经济阶层中的极端多变性。“这不是人类的本性,”涂尔干因此坚持说，“它可以为我们的需求分配必要的可变极限。因此，只要它们仅仅依赖于个体，它们就是无限的。不管任何外部调节力量，我们的感觉能力本身就是一个永不满足和无底的深渊”(1951:247)。和卢梭一样，迪尔凯姆认为这种能力是人类堕落的标志，是人类极端痛苦的根源: “无限的欲望从定义上来说是无法满足的,”他说，“而无法满足恰恰被认为是发病的标志。它们是无限的，它们不断地、无限地超越它们所能控制的手段; 它们无法被熄灭... ... 追求一个被认为无法实现的目标，就是将自己置于一种永远不快乐的状态”(1951:247-8)。

For happiness to be achieved, therefore, the passions must be constrained; and since the individual has no internal means of constraint, the passions must be restricted by some force external to the individual. Durkheim provided at least two arguments to the effect that this force could only be society. First, since it is society that has awakened our imaginations, and thus upset the natural balance between our needs and our means, it is only society - a collective, moral force - which can place limits and constraints on our desires. Second, like Rousseau in Le Contrat social, Durkheim emphasized the peculiar form of legitimacy that belongs to society — i.e., society is the only moral power superior to the individual, whose authority the individual accepts. Thus, society alone “has the power necessary to stipulate law and to set the point beyond which the passions must not go” (1951: 249). And where Rousseau had here pursued the analogy between “civilized” and “natural” man, Durkheim emphasized the similar analogy between the social and the physical or organic: “A regulative force,” Durkheim emphasized, “must play the same role for moral needs which the organism plays for physical needs” (1951: 248).

因此，为了获得幸福，激情必须受到约束; 由于个人没有内在的约束手段，激情必须受到个人外部力量的约束。涂尔干至少提供了两个论据，大意是这种力量只能是社会。首先，既然是社会唤醒了我们的想象力，从而打破了我们的需求和我们的手段之间的自然平衡，那么只有社会——一种集体的、道德的力量——才能对我们的欲望施加限制和约束。第二，像卢梭在 Le Contrat 社会，迪尔凯姆强调的特殊形式的合法性，属于社会，即，社会是唯一的道德权力优于个人，其权威的个人接受。因此，只有社会“才有必要的权力来规定法律，并设定激情不能超越的界限”(1951:249)。在卢梭追求“文明”和“自然”人之间的类比的地方，涂尔干强调了社会和物质或有机体之间的类比: “一种调节力量,”涂尔干强调，“必须为道德需求发挥与有机体为物质需求发挥相同的作用”(1951:248)。

As we have seen, Rousseau considered the general will an arbiter of class differences, one which would destroy the artihcial inequalities born of social degeneration, returning human beings to a more natural, egalitarian, and meritocratic condition. Durkheim's treatment of inequality was more sociological, and also more complacent. Society already silently estimates the reward appropriate, not (pace Rousseau) to individual talents and characters, but to particular occupations, functions, and social services. “At every moment of history,” Durkheim insisted, “there is a dim perception, in the moral consciousness of societies, of the respective value of different social services, the relative reward due to each, and the consequent degree of comfort appropriate on the average to workers in each occupation. The different functions are graded in public opinion and a certain coefhcient of well-being assigned to each, according to its place in the hierarchy ... A genuine regimen exists,” Durkheim concluded, “although not always legally formulated, which hxes with relative precision the maximum degree of ease of living to which each social class may legitimately aspire” (1951: 249).

正如我们所看到的，卢梭认为普遍意志是阶级差异的仲裁者，它将摧毁由社会退化产生的人为不平等，使人类回到更自然、平等和精英统治的状态。迪尔凯姆对待不平等的方式更加社会学化，也更加自满。社会已经悄悄地估计了适当的报酬，不是(卢梭的步伐)对个人的才能和性格，而是对特定的职业，功能和社会服务。涂尔干坚持认为: “在历史的每一个时刻，在社会的道德意识中，对于不同社会服务的各自价值、各自应得的相对回报以及由此产生的适合于每个职业的工人的平均舒适程度，都有一种模糊的认识。不同的功能在公众意见中被分级，根据它在等级制度中的位置，每个功能被分配到一定的幸福系数... ... 一个真正的制度是存在的,”迪尔凯姆总结道，“虽然并不总是合法地制定，它以相对精确的方式将每个社会阶层可能合法地渴望的最大程度的生活舒适度赋予”(1951:249)。

Assuming that the individual has “a wholesome moral constitution” - i.e., respects rules and is docile to collective authority

假设个人有“健全的道德构成”——即，尊重规则，顺从集体权威

- - society thus sets an end and a goal to his passions: “This relative limitation and the moderation it involves,” Durkheim explained, make men contented with their lot while stimulating them moderately to improve it; and this average contentment causes the feeling of calm, active happiness, the pleasure in existing and living which characterizes health for societies as well as individuals. Each person is then at least, generally speaking, in harmony with his condition, and desires only what he may legitimately hope for as the normal reward for his activity. (1951: 250)

    因此，社会为他的激情设定了一个终点和目标: “这种相对的限制和它所包含的节制,”迪尔凯姆解释说，使人们满足于他们的命运，同时适度地刺激他们来改善它; 这种平均的满足感导致平静的感觉，积极的幸福感，存在和生活的快乐，这是社会和个人健康的特征。一般来说，每个人都至少与自己的状况和谐相处，只希望得到自己合理期望的作为自己活动正常回报的东西。(1951:250)

But again, legitimacy is important. Societal constraints must include rules which fix the way that specific social positions are open and accessible to individuals, and the individuals themselves must regard this differential accessibility as fair and just. “When [discipline] is maintained only by custom and force,” Durkheim emphasized, “peace and harmony are illusory; the spirit of unrest and discontent are latent; appetites super®cially restrained are ready to revolt'' (1951: 251). But in practice, Durkheim in fact considered such conditions of unrest as abnormal and pathological, occurring only during those periods when society passes through some kind of crisis. “In normal conditions,” Durkheim assured his readers, “the collective order is regarded as just by the great majority of persons” (1951: 251-2). Like Rousseau, Durkheim thus viewed society as re-imposing

但是，合法性也很重要。社会制约因素必须包括规定具体社会地位向个人开放和可获得的方式的规则，个人本身必须认为这种差别的可获得性是公平和公正的。迪尔凯姆强调: “当(纪律)仅仅依靠习俗和力量来维持时，和平与和谐是虚幻的; 不安和不满的精神是潜伏的; 超级社会的欲望被抑制，准备反抗”(1951:251)。但在实践中，涂尔干实际上认为这种动荡状态是不正常和病态的，只有在社会经历某种危机的时候才会发生。“在正常情况下,”涂尔干向他的读者保证，“集体秩序被绝大多数人认为是公正的”(1951:251-2)。像卢梭一样，涂尔干因此认为社会是重新强加的

- - albeit in a new form - those constraints otherwise imposed on us by nature itself.

    - 尽管是以一种新的形式-这些约束是大自然本身强加给我们的。

The relevance of this argument to anomic suicide, of course, was that Durkheim regarded his own society as passing through just such an “abnormal” or “pathological” stage, a kind of “legitimation crisis'' in which society is temporarily incapable of exercising this salutary, regulative function. Social mobility “de-classifies” and “re-classi®es'' individuals upward and downward in the social hierarchy, disrupting the balance of needs and means to which human beings had become accustomed through habit and tradition: “So long as the social forces thus freed have not regained equilibrium,” Durkheim explained, “their respective values die unknown and so all regulation is lacking for a time. The limits are unknown between the possible and the impossible, what is just and what is unjust, legitimate claims and hopes and those which are immoderate. Consequently, there is no restraint upon aspirations” (1951: 253).

当然，这个论点与无规则自杀的关联在于，迪尔凯姆认为他自己的社会正在经历一个“不正常”或“病态”的阶段，一种“合法性危机”，在这种危机中，社会暂时无法行使这种有益的、调节性的功能。社会流动性使个体在社会等级制度中向上和向下“去分类”和“重新分类”，打破了人类通过习惯和传统已经习惯的需求和手段之间的平衡: “只要这样被解放的社会力量还没有恢复平衡,”涂尔干解释说，“他们各自的价值观就会消亡，因此所有的规则在一段时间内都是缺乏的。可能与不可能、什么是正义和什么是不正义、合法的要求和希望以及那些过分的要求和希望之间的界限是未知的。因此，对愿望没有约束”(1951:253)。

This was a condition familiar to Rousseau. In the introduction to his translation of Emile, Allan Bloom emphasized the extent to which its author sought to warn us of “a certain low human type” — i.e., the bourgeois — which Rousseau himself “was the hrst to isolate and name” (1979a: 4—5). Who is the bourgeois? To describe the inner workings of his soul, Bloom responds, “he is the man who, when dealing with others, thinks only of himself, and on the other hand, in his understanding of himself, thinks only of others.” Rousseau contrasts this “debased form of the species” with both the natural man

这是卢梭所熟悉的情况。在《埃米尔》译本的导言中，艾伦 · 布鲁姆强调了作者试图警告我们“某种低等的人类类型”ーー即资产阶级ーー的程度，卢梭本人就是“将其孤立并命名的最高人类类型”(1979a: 4-5)。谁是资产阶级？在描述自己灵魂的内在运作时，布鲁姆回答说: “他是这样一个人，在与他人打交道时，他只考虑自己，而在另一方面，在他对自己的理解中，他只考虑他人。”卢梭将这种“堕落的物种形式”与自然人进行了对比

- — whole, independent, concerned only with himself — and the citizen

    ー完整、独立、只关心自己ー还有公民 - — whose “very being consists in his relation to his city, who understands his good to be identical with the common good.” The imagination of the bourgeois has expanded his needs beyond his means, rendering him both artihcial and dependent on others, whom he seeks to exploit; and Christianity has convinced him that his own good should be distinguished from that of civil society, leaving him no reason to sacrihce private interest to public duty.[93](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark105) Since Rousseau, Bloom insists, the overcoming of the bourgeois has been regarded as almost identical with the realization of true democracy, and the achievement of “genuine personality” (1979a: 6).

    他们的“存在就在于他们与城市的关系，他们明白他们的利益与共同利益是一致的。”资产阶级的想象力扩大了他的需求，超出了他的能力范围，使他成为人身主义者，并依赖于他人，他试图利用这些人; 基督教使他相信，他自己的利益应该与公民社会的利益区分开来，使他没有理由牺牲个人利益来履行公共职责。布鲁姆坚持认为，自卢梭以来，对资产阶级的克服被认为几乎等同于实现真正的民主，以及“真正的人格”的成就(1979a: 6)。

Durkheim’s contempt for the bourgeois — although framed in the vocabulary of modern social science — rivaled that of Rousseau. For in addition to the “acute” anomie produced by economic crises, Durkheim identihed a more “chronic” anomie in the sphere of business and industry, born of the collapse of feudalism and the rise of unregulated capitalism. Durkheim’s account of feudal institutions thus borders on nostalgia — e.g., by regulating salaries, prices, and production itself, the guilds “indirectly hxed the average level of income on which needs are partially based by the very force of circumstances”; the state “restrained the scope of economic functions by its supremacy over them and by the relatively subordinate role it assigned them’’; and religion

迪尔凯姆对资产阶级的蔑视ーー尽管是用现代社会科学的词汇来描述的ーー堪比卢梭。因为除了经济危机造成的“严重”失范之外，涂尔干还指出了商业和工业领域的一种更为“长期”的失范，这种失范源于封建制度的崩溃和不受管制的资本主义的兴起。迪尔凯姆对封建制度的描述因此接近于怀旧情结ーー例如，通过调节工资、价格和生产本身，行会“间接地限制了平均收入水平，而这种平均收入水平的需求部分是由环境的力量决定的”; 国家“通过其对行会的至高无上地位和赋予它们的相对从属地位来限制经济职能的范围”; 以及宗教

was felt alike by workers and masters, the poor and the rich. It consoled the former and taught them contentment with their lot by informing them of the providential nature of the social order, that the share of each class was assigned by God himself, and by holding out the hope for just compensation in a world to come in return for the inequalities of this world. It governed the latter, recalling that worldly interests are not man’s entire lot, that they must be subordinate to other and higher interests, and that they should therefore not be pursued without rule or measure. (1951: 254—5) This passage is particularly striking in its implication that, for Durkheim as for Rousseau, social realism provided a kind of secular theodicy, reconciling individuals to their lots in life, through the belief in a higher power which was itself the very standard of social justice.

工人和主人，穷人和富人都感同身受。它通过告诉他们社会秩序的幸运本质，告诉他们每个阶层的份额是上帝自己分配的，并且通过在一个世界中为这个世界的不平等提供公正的补偿，来安慰前者，教会他们对自己的命运感到满足。它支配着后者，回顾到世俗利益并不是人的全部命运，它们必须服从于其他和更高的利益，因此不应该没有规则或措施就追求它们。(1951:254ー5)这段文字特别引人注目，它暗示着，对于涂尔干和卢梭来说，社会现实主义提供了一种世俗神学，通过对更高权力的信仰(这本身就是社会正义的标准) ，使个人与他们生活中的命运和解。

The nostalgic tone of his description of feudalism notwithstanding, Durkheim was hardly calling for a return to the Middle Ages. On the contrary, his point was rather to emphasize that these traditional sources of constraint ± i.e., the guilds, the state, and the church ± had declined, and that nothing had come to take their place. This, of course, was the reason for the fascination with “Christian societies” discussed in chapter 2 (see pp. 46±56). The appetites excited by industrial capitalism, Durkheim argued, “have become freed of any limiting authority. By sanctifying them, so to speak, this apotheosis of well-being has placed them above all human law. Their restraint seems like a sort of sacrilege.” In the sphere of business and commerce, therefore, anomie was chronic: “From top to bottom,” Durkheim observed, “greed is aroused without knowing where to hnd ultimate foothold. Nothing can calm it, since its goal is far beyond all it can attain.” So constant is this condition, Durkheim added, that society has come to view it as normal, and even to elevate it into an ethical and quasi-religious principle. “It is everlastingly repeated,” he reminded his readers, “that it is man’s nature to be eternally dissatished, constantly to advance, without relief or rest, toward an indehnite goal. The longing for inhnity is daily represented as a mark of moral distinction, whereas it can only appear within unregulated consciences which elevate to a rule the lack of rule from which they suffer. The doctrine of the most ruthless and swift progress,’’ Durkheim concluded, “has become an article of faith’’(1951: 255±6).

尽管迪尔凯姆对封建主义的描述带有怀旧的基调，但他几乎没有呼吁回到中世纪。相反，他的观点是强调这些传统的约束来源，即行会、国家和教会已经衰落，没有任何东西取代了它们的位置。当然，这就是第二章所讨论的“基督教社会”如此迷人的原因(见46 ± 56页)。迪尔凯姆认为，工业资本主义激起的欲望“已经摆脱了任何限制性的权威。可以说，通过使他们神圣化，这种幸福的神化使他们凌驾于所有人类法律之上。他们的克制似乎是一种亵渎。”因此，在商业领域，失范是长期存在的: “从上到下,”涂尔干观察到，“贪婪被唤起，却不知道最终立足点在哪里。”。没有什么能使它平静下来，因为它的目标远远超出了它所能达到的。”涂尔干补充说，这种状况是如此的持续，以至于社会开始将其视为正常现象，甚至将其提升为一种伦理和准宗教原则。他提醒读者，“人的本性就是永远不满足，不断前进，没有放松或休息，朝着一个不可阻挡的目标前进。对内在的渴望每天都被表现为道德区别的标志，然而它只能出现在不受管制的良心中，这种良心将他们所遭受的缺乏规则的痛苦提升为一种规则。涂尔干总结道: “最无情和最迅速的进步的教义已经成为一种信仰”(1951:255 ± 6)。

Perhaps more than anything else he wrote, Durkheim’s treatment of anomic suicide makes clear that his injunction to treat social facts comme des choses was a moral as well as a methodological injunction. This in turn indicates the nature and extent of his debt to Rousseau.[94](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark106) And hnally, it explains why he felt so much was at stake in his exchange with Tarde, to whose “Les Deux Elements de la sociologie” he at last responded in the third, concluding book of Le Suicide. When “collective tendencies” or “collective passions” are spoken of, Durkheim admitted, we often assume that these are mere metaphors for a number of average individual states. But social facts are not mere metaphors, but rather real, natural things, whose description Durkheim continuously couched in the vocabulary of permanence, necessity, and impersonality. “So truly are [social facts] things sui generis, and not mere verbal entities,” he insisted, “that they may be measured, their relative sizes compared, as is done with the intensity of electric currents or luminous foci” (1951: 310). This is why the suicide statistics cited throughout Le Suicide possess a stability and regularity exceeding even those of the mortality rate. And as with mortality (a product of material forces), Durkheim thus argued, “we must likewise admit that [acts of suicide] depend on forces external to individuals” (1951: 309). These forces, of course, must be moral rather than material; and since — aside from individual human beings — there is no type of moral existence other than society, these forces must be social as well.

涂尔干对无名氏自杀的处理，也许比他写的其他任何东西都更清楚地表明，他要求将社会事实视为事物的命令，既是一种道德上的命令，也是一种方法论上的命令。这反过来说明了他欠卢梭的债务的性质和程度。94同样，这也解释了为什么他在与塔尔德的交流中感到如此危险，他最终在《自杀》的第三部总结性著作《社会学的两个要素》中回应了塔尔德。涂尔干承认，当提到“集体倾向”或“集体激情”时，我们常常认为这些仅仅是一些普通个体状态的隐喻。但是，社会事实不仅仅是隐喻，而是真实的、自然的事物，涂尔干一直用永恒、必然和非个性的词汇来描述这些事物。“[社会事实]是独特的，而不仅仅是语言实体,”他坚持说，“它们可以被测量，它们的相对大小可以比较，就像电流强度或发光焦点一样”(1951:310)。这就是为什么整个《自杀》中引用的自杀统计数据具有稳定性和规律性，甚至超过了死亡率。与死亡(物质力量的产物)一样，迪尔凯姆因此认为，“我们必须同样承认，[自杀行为]依赖于个人外部的力量”(1951:309)。当然，这些力量必须是道德的，而不是物质的; 因为除了个人以外，除了社会以外，没有其他类型的道德存在，这些力量也必须是社会的。

In Durkheim’s mind, this argument thoroughly discredited the theories of Tarde. For Tarde’s explanation of social phenomena — i.e., that they are passed on from one individual to another through imitation — could not possibly account for the statistical stability and regularity of suicide rates. Using the same language he had adopted in his lectures on Le Contrat social, Durkheim argued that these rates can only be due to the permanent action of some impersonal cause which transcends all individual cases. “The terms,’’ Durkheim insisted, “must be strictly understood. Collective tendencies have an existence of their own; they are forces as real as cosmic forces, though of another sort; they, likewise, affect the individual from without, though through other channels.’’ Durkheim recognized that this argument offended common sense; but in this, he added, it is no different from any new scientihc proposition. More importantly, it implied that “collective tendencies and thoughts are of a different nature from individual tendencies and thoughts, that the former have characteristics which the latter lack’’ (1951: 310, 309).

在涂尔干看来，这种论点彻底否定了塔尔德的理论。对于塔德对社会现象的解释ーー即这些现象是通过模仿从一个人传递给另一个人ーー不可能解释自杀率的统计稳定性和规律性。迪尔凯姆在《社会契约论》的演讲中使用了同样的语言，他认为，这些比率只能是由于某种超越所有个案的非个人原因的永久性行为造成的。“这些条款,”涂尔干坚持说，“必须严格理解。集体倾向有它们自己的存在; 它们是像宇宙力量一样真实的力量，虽然是另一种; 它们同样从外部影响个体，虽然是通过其他渠道。”涂尔干承认这个论点违反了常识，但是在这一点上，他补充说，它与任何新的科学命题没有什么不同。更重要的是，它暗示了“集体倾向和思想与个人倾向和思想具有不同的性质，前者具有后者所缺乏的特征”(1951:310,309)。

But how can this be if there are only individuals in society? Here Durkheim followed his traditional strategy, learned from Boutroux, of appealing to the analogy with chemistry and biology. As with chemical elements and biological cells, Durkheim argued, when the consciousnesses of individual human beings are grouped and combined, “something in the world has been altered.'' This change then “produces others, this novelty engenders other novelties, [and] phenomena appear whose characteristic qualities are not found in the elements composing them'' (1951: 310—11). The only alternative is to argue that the whole is qualitatively identical with the sum of its parts, and that an effect is qualitatively reducible to the sum of its causes. But this, Durkheim observed, is precisely what Tarde has argued — a position for which Durkheim could ®nd only two, “truly extraordinary” reasons.

但是，如果社会中只有个体，这怎么可能呢？在这里，迪尔凯姆遵循了他从 Boutroux 那里学到的传统策略，即利用化学和生物学的类比。涂尔干认为，就像化学元素和生物细胞一样，当个体的意识被组合在一起时，“世界上的某些东西已经被改变了。”然后这种变化“产生其他的，这种新奇产生其他的新奇，[和]现象出现，其特征性质在组成它们的元素中没有发现”(1951:310ー11)。唯一的选择是认为整体在性质上等同于各部分的总和，而一种效应在性质上可以简化为其原因的总和。但是，涂尔干观察到，这正是塔尔德所主张的ーー这一立场是涂尔干可以而且只有两个“真正非同寻常”的理由。

The ®rst reason given by Tarde, as we have seen, was that “in sociology we have through a rare privilege intimate knowledge both of that element which is our individual consciousness and of the compound which is the sum of consciousness in individuals.” But to Durkheim, who had visited with Wundt at Leipzig and was a friend of Ribot and Janet, this seemed to deny all of the contemporary psychology of the unconscious. “Today,” Durkheim reminded Tarde, “it is generally recognized that psychical life, far from being directly cognizable, has on the contrary profound depths inaccessible to ordinary perception, to which we attain only gradually by devious and complicated paths like those employed by the sciences of the external world. The nature of consciousness is therefore far from lacking in mystery for the future'' (1951: 311). In fact, the real key to understanding this response to Tarde's ®rst argument lies in recognizing that, for Durkheim, the distinction was not one between the “psychological” and the “sociological,” but rather one between the “individual” and the “social.” Indeed, as he would make abundantly clear just one year later,[95](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark107) Durkheim readily acceded to the notion that social life has a “psychic” aspect, and that it is “made up of'' representations. But these collective representations, Durkheim insisted, are “of quite another character'' from individual representations. Consider the case of primitive religion, whose origins are ordinarily — and quite wrongly — ascribed to “feelings of fear or reverence inspired in conscious persons by mysterious and dreaded beings.'' From this perspective, Durkheim observed, religion “seems merely like the development of individual states of mind and private feelings.'' But several facts — e.g., that religion is unknown to animals, whose social life is rudimentary; that religion is never found except where the societal mode of organization exists; that religions vary with these forms of social organization; etc. ± suggest strongly that religious forces are really social forces: “The power thus imposed on [our] respect and become the object of [our] adoration is society, of which the gods [are] only the hypostatic form. Religion is in a word the system of symbols by means of which society becomes conscious of itself; it is the characteristic way of thinking of collective existence” (1951: 312). Here, Durkheim thus concluded his reply to Tarde’s ®rst argument, is “a group of states of mind which would not have originated if individual states of consciousness had not combined, and which result from this union and are superadded to those which derive from individual natures.’’ The claim of Tarde’s ®rst argument notwithstanding, no analysis of individual human minds could possibly explain the origin and development of such religious beliefs and practices; and the same argument applies to law, morals, customs, political institutions, educational practices ± in short, to all forms of social life (1951: 312±13).

正如我们所看到的，塔德给出的第一个原因是“在社会学中，我们通过一种罕见的特权，对我们的个人意识这一元素和个人意识的总和这一复合体都有着深入的了解。”但是对于迪尔凯姆来说，这似乎否定了所有当代潜意识心理学。迪尔凯姆曾在莱比锡拜访过冯特，并且是里伯特和珍妮特的朋友。涂尔干提醒塔德: “今天，人们普遍认识到，精神生活远非直接可知，相反，它具有普通感知所无法达到的深度，我们只能通过像外部世界科学所采用的那些迂回而复杂的途径，逐渐达到这种深度。因此，意识的本质并不缺乏对未来的神秘性”(1951:311)。事实上，理解这种对 Tarde 第一个论点的反应的真正关键在于认识到，对迪尔凯姆来说，区分不是“心理学”和“社会学”之间的区别，而是“个人”和“社会”之间的区别事实上，就在一年之后，涂尔干非常清楚地表明，他欣然接受了社会生活有一个“精神”方面的观点，即它是“由”表征“组成的”。但涂尔干坚持认为，这些集体表征与个人表征“完全是另一种性质”。考虑一下原始宗教的例子，它的起源通常被错误地归因于“神秘而可怕的生物在有意识的人身上激发的恐惧感或敬畏感。”从这个角度来看，涂尔干注意到，宗教“似乎仅仅是个人心态和私人感情的发展。”但有几个事实ーー例如，动物对宗教一无所知，它们的社会生活还处于初级阶段; 除非存在社会组织模式，否则永远找不到宗教; 宗教随着这些社会组织形式的不同而不同; 等等 ± 强烈暗示，宗教力量实际上是社会力量: “强加于[我们的]尊重并成为[我们的]崇拜对象的力量是社会，而神只是社会的实体形式。总而言之，宗教是社会意识到自己的符号系统; 它是集体存在的典型思维方式”(1951:312)。在这里，涂尔干因此总结了他对塔尔德第一个论点的答复，是“如果个体意识状态没有结合起来，就不会产生的一组精神状态，它们是这种结合的结果，并且与那些源于个体本性的精神状态相加。”尽管塔德提出了第一个论点，但是没有任何对人类个体思想的分析可以解释这些宗教信仰和实践的起源和发展; 同样的论点也适用于法律、道德、习俗、政治制度、教育实践，简而言之，适用于所有形式的社会生活(1951:312 ± 13)。

Tarde’s second argument was that, if we subtract the individual, “nothing remains of the social.’’ Durkheim’s initial response to this was that it was a purely arbitrary assertion. “The author may of course state that in his personal opinion nothing real exists in society but what is individual,” Durkheim acknowledged, “but proofs supporting this statement are lacking and discussion is therefore impossible.” And there are a great many persons, Durkheim added, who conceive of society, not as something “spontaneously assumed by individual nature on expanding outward,’’ but rather as “an antagonistic force restricting individual natures and resisted by them!’’ (1951: 311). But Durkheim’s second, more productive and sociologically interesting response was that it simply isn’t true that society is made up only of individuals. For one thing, society includes material things ± i.e., social facts that have become materialized even to the point of becoming elements in the external world. Such “crystallized” social facts (e.g., styles of art and architecture, forms of technology, religious doctrines, legal precepts, etc.) certainly exist outside of us, precede and survive our temporal existence, have consequences for our behavior, and sometimes resist our intentional efforts. But, more importantly, these visible symbols express a far larger and more powerful realm of moral forces, at least equally external, long-lived, consequential, and resistant to individual human effort. “Nothing is more reasonable,” Durkheim thus concluded, “than this proposition at which such offense has been taken; that a belief or social practice may exist independently of its individual expressions” (1951: 320).

塔德的第二个论点是，如果我们减去个体，“社会的一切都不复存在了。”涂尔干对此的最初反应是，这纯粹是一种武断的主张。迪尔凯姆承认: “作者当然可以说，在他个人看来，社会中除了个人之外，没有什么是真实存在的，但是支持这种说法的证据是缺乏的，因此讨论是不可能的。”迪尔凯姆补充说，有很多人认为社会不是“由个体本性自发地向外扩张”的东西，而是“一种限制个体本性并受其抵制的对抗性力量!”(1951:311).但是迪尔凯姆的第二个，更有生产力和社会学意义的回答是，社会仅仅由个人组成是不正确的。一方面，社会包括物质的东西，也就是说，社会事实已经物化，甚至成为外部世界的要素。这些“具体化”的社会事实(例如，艺术和建筑的风格、技术的形式、宗教教义、法律戒律等等)当然存在于我们之外，先于我们的时间存在并存活下来，对我们的行为产生影响，有时还会抵制我们有意的努力。但是，更重要的是，这些可见的符号表达了一个更大和更强大的道德力量的领域，至少同样外部的，长期的，结果，并抵制个人的努力。涂尔干这样总结道: “没有什么比这个命题更合理的了，在这个命题中，这种冒犯已经被采取了; 一种信仰或社会实践可能独立于它的个别表达而存在”(1951:320)。

In my introduction I emphasized that Durkheim's social realist vocabulary embodied at least two elements: on the one hand, it described society as not only “similar to'' nature, but as itself a real, natural thing, a part of nature; on the other hand, it insisted that society is a particular, distinctive part of nature, a reality sui generis, irreducible to psychology or biology. Although not oblivious to the second element, the Latin thesis and De la division du travail social tended to focus on the ®rst; and for Durkheim's purposes in these works, Rousseau - for whom society was always the product of art rather than nature — was a constant object of criticism. But as Durkheim became more involved in the Dreyfus Affair, and more frustrated by his quarrel with Tarde, he increasingly sought a language that would do justice to the distinctive nature of social facts, and particularly their obligatory character. This led him to stronger reading of Rousseau, in whose works he now discovered a language that described society as a “live, organized body,'' a reality distinct from and greater than the sum of its parts, capable of imposing constraints on the egoistic appetites and desires of individuals. The civil state thus recreated the state of nature — i.e., that condition in which appetite and desire were constrained by the laws of nature — albeit in a new, moral for m; but this new form, though moral, was no less natural, for societies are also a part of nature. To learn the laws that govern societies is thus to learn our place in the natural world, and it was this education a l’ecole des choses that Durkheim sought to describe and institutionalize in L’Evolution pedagogique and L’Education morale. The famous injunction to study facts comme des choses was certainly “methodological” in some sense; but more than this, it was part of Durkheim's larger enterprise — shared with Rousseau — of imposing limitations on a population increasingly indifferent to constraints of any kind.

在我的序言中，我强调涂尔干的社会现实主义词汇至少包含两个要素: 一方面，它不仅将社会描述为“类似”自然，而且将其本身描述为一个真实的、自然的事物，自然的一部分; 另一方面，它坚持认为社会是自然的一个特殊的、独特的部分，一个独特的、不可还原到心理学或生物学的现实。尽管并非没有第二个要素，但拉丁文论点和社会工作的德拉分工倾向于关注第一个要素; 对于涂尔干在这些作品中的目的来说，卢梭——对他来说，社会永远是艺术的产物，而不是自然——是一个经常受到批评的对象。但是，随着涂尔干越来越多地卷入德雷福斯事件，并且对他与塔德的争吵越来越感到失望，他越来越多地寻求一种语言，能够公正地对待社会事实的独特性，特别是它们的义务性质。这导致他更深入地解读卢梭，在卢梭的作品中，他现在发现了一种语言，将社会描述为一个“活生生的、有组织的身体”，一个与其各部分之和截然不同、大于其各部分之和的现实，能够对个人的利己主义欲望和欲望施加限制。文明国家因此重建了自然状态ーー即食欲和欲望受到自然法则约束的状态ーー尽管是以一种新的、对我而言是道德的形式; 但这种新的形式，尽管是道德的，却同样是自然的，因为社会也是自然的一部分。因此，学习支配社会的法则就是学习我们在自然世界中的位置，正是这种教育，涂尔干试图在《进化论》的教育学和《教育道德》中描述并制度化。著名的研究事实的命令在某种意义上肯定是“方法论的”; 但更重要的是，它是迪尔凯姆更大计划的一部分ーー与卢梭共同的计划ーー对一个对任何形式的限制都越来越漠不关心的人口施加限制。

It might seem odd that my interpretation — which has frequently been orthogonal to accounts of Durkheim as the heir of Comte, child of the Enlightenment, and descendant of Descartes — should thus culminate with the two greatest social theorists of 18th-century France. But this oddity disappears when we recall that neither Montesquieu nor Rousseau was a typical ®gure of the French Enlightenment. On the contrary, De l’esprit des lois was an inspiration to Savigny and the German jurists, just as Fichte was an early admirer of Rousseau. In Montesquieu's extremely ambivalent Cartesianism, and Rousseau's “yoke of necessity, under which every ®nite being must bow,'' Durkheim found the linguistic resources he needed, ®rst to explore tentatively, and then to fill out his account of the distinctive, obligatory nature of social facts. As a moral authority transcending any individual mind, society thus provided a secular theodicy for citizens of the Third Republic. In his discussion of egoism and anomie in Le Suicide, Durkheim's social realism received its most complete and productive expression.

我的解释——经常与迪尔凯姆作为孔德的继承人、启蒙运动的孩子、笛卡尔的后裔的说法正好相反——因此以18世纪法国两位最伟大的社会理论家的观点达到顶峰，这似乎有些奇怪。但当我们回想起孟德斯鸠和卢梭都不是法国启蒙运动的典型代表时，这种怪异就消失了。相反，论法的精神对萨维尼和德国法学家是一种鼓舞，正如费希特早期崇拜卢梭一样。在孟德斯鸠极端矛盾的笛卡尔主义和卢梭的“必然的枷锁，每个夜晚都必须鞠躬”中，迪尔凯姆找到了他所需要的语言资源，首先是试探性地探索，然后是填写他对社会事实的独特的、强制性的本质的解释。作为一种超越任何个人思想的道德权威，社会因此为第三共和国的公民提供了一种世俗的神学。迪尔凯姆在《自杀》中对利己主义和失范主义的探讨，使他的社会现实主义得到了最完整和最有成效的表达。

In this book, I’ve tried to describe the development of Durkheim’s social realism less as the “discovery” of some new, hitherto unnoticed aspect of nature than as the gradual cobbling together of a vocabulary that might prove useful in speaking about it. My focus has thus been on the nature of Durkheim’s interests and purposes, the writers whose language he found adaptable to them, and the works in which the re-description of these writers and the adaptation of their vocabularies was effected. As a consequence, the Durkheim who emerges from this account may seem unfamiliar and even unattractive to some sociologists. The Sens lecturer, of course, is a complete stranger; but even the Durkheim of L'Evolution pedagogique en France and L'Education morale, of the “German” essays of 1887, of the Latin thesis and the lecture-courses on Du contrat social and Emile, of Wundt rather than Comte, Comenius rather than Descartes, is someone who rarely affords us our “usual and carefully contrived pleasures of recognition.” Not unreasonably, such sociologists might ask why they should bother to become acquainted with such a figure at all. My answer — anticipated in my introduction — is that the value of such acquaintance derives precisely from this lack of familiarity, from that fact that Durkheim was indeed quite different from us. In short, this book has been concerned with the “historical” (by contrast with “rational”) reconstruction of Durkheim’s social realism; and the rewards of historical reconstructions are to be found, not in reassurance or self-justification, but in the “selfknowledge” or “self-awareness” that follows an encounter with vocabularies other than one’s own.

在这本书中，我试图描述涂尔干的社会现实主义的发展，与其说是对自然界某些新的、迄今为止未被注意到的方面的“发现”，不如说是对一些词汇的逐渐拼凑，这些词汇可能被证明对谈论自然有用。因此，我的重点是迪尔凯姆的兴趣和目的的性质，作家的语言，他发现适应他们，以及在这些作家的重新描述和他们的词汇的适应是有影响的作品。因此，从这个叙述中出现的涂尔干对于一些社会学家来说可能是陌生的，甚至是没有吸引力的。当然，森斯的讲师是一个完全陌生的人; 但即使是迪尔凯姆的《法国进化教育学》和《教育士气》 ，1887年的《德国》散文，拉丁文论文，以及关于杜与社会和埃米尔的演讲课程，冯特而不是孔德，夸美纽斯而不是笛卡尔，也是一个很少给我们提供“通常和精心设计的认可的快乐”的人这些社会学家可能会问，他们为什么要费心去了解这样一个人物呢。我的回答ーー在我的序言中已经预料到ーー是，这种相识的价值恰恰来自于这种不相识，来自于涂尔干确实与我们大不相同的事实。简而言之，这本书关注的是迪尔凯姆的社会现实主义的“历史性”(与“理性”相反)重建; 而历史重建的回报不在于自我保证或自我辩护，而在于“自我认识”或“自我意识”，即在与自己以外的词汇相遇之后。

Richard Rorty has provided a useful account of how such selfknowledge and self-awareness might be achieved. Each of us, he suggests, carries around something he calls a “final vocabulary” — i.e., a set of words (e.g., “true,” “good,” “right,” “beautiful,”

理查德 · 罗蒂对如何实现这种自我认识和自我意识提供了一个有用的说明。他认为，我们每个人都带着一些他称之为“最终词汇”的东西ーー即一组词(例如，“真”、“好”、“对”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、“美”、

“progressive,” “professional,” “rigorous,” etc.) we use to justify our actions, our beliefs, and our selves. These are the words we use to praise our friends, condemn our enemies, express our deepest selfdoubts and our highest hopes ± in short, to tell, whether prospectively or retrospectively, the stories of our lives. Such a vocabulary is “final” in the sense that, if doubt is cast upon the value of these words, we have no non-circular argumentative recourse. Whatever arguments we might present to defend the value of these words must be constructed from the words themselves. This vocabulary, therefore, is “final” in the sense that it is as far as we can go with language, and beyond it lies only resignation or the resort to force (i989c: 73).

我们用“进步”、“专业”、“严谨”等等来为我们的行为、信仰和自我辩护。这些词语是我们用来赞美朋友，谴责敌人，表达我们最深的自我怀疑和最高的希望，简而言之，是用来讲述我们生活中的故事，无论是前瞻性的还是回顾性的。这样的词汇在某种意义上是“最终的”，如果对这些词汇的价值产生怀疑，我们就没有非循环的辩论资源。无论我们提出什么论据来捍卫这些词的价值，都必须从这些词本身构建出来。因此，在这个意义上，这个词汇是“最终的”，因为它是我们能够与语言走到的最远的地方，超越它的只有顺从或诉诸武力(i989c: 73)。

The “ironist” is someone who has radical, continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she uses. This is because she’s encountered other ®nal vocabularies with which she's been impressed, either by meeting other people or by reading lots of books. The ironist recognizes that arguments phrased within her present vocabulary cannot underwrite or dissolve these doubts, for these arguments would be circular; and she also recognizes that nothing beyond her vocabulary — no “foundation,” natural or supernatural, physical or metaphysical — can justify, verify, or certify her own way of thinking and speaking. For the ironist, therefore, there are simply multiple, ®nal vocabularies, and there is no neutral, meta-vocabulary within which universal criteria for the choice among other vocabularies might be formulated. Rorty’s ironist is thus “meta-stable” in the sense intended by Sartre — i.e., never quite able to take herself seriously, because she is always aware that the terms in which she describes herself are fragile, contingent, and thus subject to change (l989c: 73—4).

“讽刺者”是指对自己使用的最终词汇有激进的、持续的怀疑的人。这是因为她遇到了其他让她印象深刻的非英语词汇，无论是通过与其他人见面还是通过阅读大量的书籍。讽刺者认识到，用她现有的词汇表述的论点不能支持或消除这些怀疑，因为这些论点将是循环的; 她还认识到，超出她的词汇表之外的任何东西ーー没有“基础”，自然的或超自然的，物理的或形而上学的ーー都不能证明、证实或证明她自己的思维和说话方式。因此，对于讽刺者来说，只是有多种非本体词汇，并且没有中性的元词汇，在这些词汇中可以制定其他词汇的选择的通用标准。因此，罗蒂的讽刺作家在萨特意图的意义上是“元稳定的”ーー也就是说，她从来没有能够把自己当回事，因为她总是意识到，她描述自己的术语是脆弱的，偶然的，因此受到变化(1989c: 73-4)。

By contrast to the ironist, a “metaphysician” is someone who assumes that the presence of a word in his ®nal vocabulary ensures that it actually refers to something more essential or more real. The metaphysician, in short, doesn’t question the platitudes that encapsulate the use of a particular ®nal vocabulary, and especially the platitude that says there is a single per manent reality to be found behind the many temporary appearances. This point is often made by saying that the metaphysician believes that the world is “really out there.’’ But simply to say that the world is “out there’’ — i.e., that it is not our own creation but rather the product of other causes — is to say something that the ironist also believes. The signi®cant difference between the ironist and the metaphysician is thus that the latter makes the additional assertion that the truth is “out there'' ± i.e., that there is a non-human language that the world wants to speak. The ironist, by contrast, is persuaded that nature doesn't speak, that only people do, and that people cannot step outside their language in order to compare their sentences with something more basic, intrinsic, essential, or foundational (1989c: 74—8). The ironist thus resists speaking of any “essential reality'' — natural or social — to which her utterances might be said to correspond.

与反讽者相反，“形而上学家”是这样一种人，他们认为在自己的词汇表中出现一个词，确保它实际上指的是更本质或更真实的东西。简而言之，形而上学家并不质疑那些用来概括特定词汇的陈词滥调，尤其是那些说在许多暂时的表象背后存在着一个永恒的现实的陈词滥调。这一点经常被说成是形而上学家相信世界“真的存在”但是，简单地说世界“在那里”ーー也就是说，世界不是我们自己创造的，而是其他原因的产物ーー就是在说一些讽刺者也相信的东西。讽刺主义者和形而上学者之间的显著区别在于，形而上学者做出了额外的断言，即真理是“存在的”，也就是说，世界想要说的是一种非人类的语言。相比之下，讽刺者相信大自然不会说话，只有人才会说话，人们不能跳出自己的语言，将自己的句子与更基本的、内在的、本质的或基础的东西进行比较(1989c: 74ー8)。因此，讽刺者拒绝谈论任何“本质的现实”ーー自然的或社会的ーー她的话可以说是对应的。

Rorty adds that this confusion — i.e., between the notion that the world is out there and the notion that the truth is out there — is exacerbated by the focus on individual sentences rather than whole vocabularies. As long as we limit our attention to sentences like “Protestants commit suicide more frequently than Catholics or Jews,'' or “the members of central Australian clans are forbidden to kill or eat the totemic animal except at an annual feast called the Intichiumaf for example, it is easy to confuse: (a) the undeniable fact that the world contains the causes of our feeling justihed in holding such beliefs with (b) the quite different, and thoroughly deniable, claim that some non-linguistic state of the world makes these beliefs true by “corresponding” to them. Such confusion is less frequent, however, when we turn from individual, criterion-governed sentences within language games to language games as wholes (i.e., games which we do not choose between by reference to criteria at all). Does the world speak Aristotelian or Copernican? Does the language of Kant or that of Nietzsche more adequately correspond to reality? Does nature prefer to be described by St. Augustine or by Freud?

罗蒂补充说，这种混淆ーー即世界在那里的概念和真理在那里的概念之间的混淆ーー由于注重单个句子而不是整个词汇而加剧。只要我们把注意力限制在诸如“新教徒比天主教徒或犹太教徒更频繁地自杀”，或者“澳大利亚中部宗族的成员被禁止杀死或者吃掉图腾动物，除非是在一个叫做 Intichiummaf 的年度宴会上，例如，它很容易混淆: (a)不可否认的事实是，世界包含了我们持有这种信仰的正当感受的原因; (b)完全不同的，完全可否认的，声称世界的某种非语言状态使这些信仰通过“对应”而成真。然而，当我们从语言游戏中个别的、受标准管理的句子转向整体的语言游戏(也就是说，我们根本没有参照标准来进行选择的游戏)时，这种混淆就不那么频繁了。这个世界说的是亚里士多德式的还是哥白尼式的？康德的语言或尼采的语言是否更适合于现实？大自然喜欢被 St. Augustine 描述还是被弗洛伊德描述？

But this observation — i.e., that the world does not tell us what vocabulary to use — does not mean that the choices we make about which language games to play are arbitrary or subjective. It simply means that, when it comes to changes from one vocabulary to another, the notions of “decision,” “criteria” and “choice” are no longer useful. Europeans, Rorty observes, did not “decide” to adopt the idiom of romantic poetry, or socialist politics, or Galilean mechanics; on the contrary, they just gradually lost the habit of playing some language games, and gradually acquired the habit of playing others. It was not on the basis of telescopic observations, Kuhn argues in The Copernican Revolution, that Europeans “decided” that the heliocentric theory was correct, or that macroscopic behavior could be explained on the basis of microscopic motion, or that prediction and control should be the goal of scientihc theory; rather, after a hundred years of inconclusive debate, Europeans found themselves speaking “Galilean” rather than “Aristotelian,” and took the interconnected theses of the former for granted (Rorty 1989b: 6; see Kuhn 1957).

但是这种观察ーー也就是说，这个世界没有告诉我们使用什么词汇ーー并不意味着我们对于玩什么语言游戏所做的选择是武断的或主观的。它仅仅意味着，当涉及到从一个词汇表到另一个词汇表的变化时，“决定”、“标准”和“选择”这些概念就不再有用了。罗蒂观察到，欧洲人并没有“决定”采用浪漫主义诗歌、社会主义政治、加利利机械学的成语，相反，他们只是逐渐失去了玩一些语言游戏的习惯，逐渐养成了玩其他语言游戏的习惯。库恩在《哥白尼革命》(The Copernican Revolution)一书中指出，欧洲人“决定”日心说是正确的，或者宏观行为可以在微观运动的基础上解释，或者预测和控制应该是科学理论的目标，而不是基于望远镜观察; 相反，经过100年的不确定性辩论，欧洲人发现自己说的是“伽利略”而不是“亚里士多德”，并把前者相互关联的论点视为理所当然(罗蒂1989b: 6; 见库恩1957)。

By now, the distinction between metaphysicians and ironists should be clear. The metaphysician, for example, will see Durkheim as having made a discovery “about the world” — i.e., that social forces are natural forces, distinguished by their characteristics of externality and constraint. The ironist will see Durkheim as someone frustrated with the language that he and his contemporaries had inherited from the 17th and 18th centuries, who managed to cobble together a normative vocabulary that worked better for 19th- and 20th-century purposes; and once sociologists found out what could be done with a Durkheimian vocabulary, few were interested in doing the things that had been done with its Cartesian predecessor. The metaphysician still seeks to ful®l the pre-Kantian, Enlightenment dream of “getting the world right,” of describing societies in Nature’s Own Language. The ironist, by contrast, has embraced the notion shared by French revolutionaries, Hegel, the romantic poets, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida, Dewey, James, Davidson, Rorty, and others, that language is solely a human creation, that anything can be transformed simply by being re-described, and that to change how we talk is to change who we are.

到目前为止，形而上学家和讽刺家之间的区别应该是明确的。例如，形而上学家将迪尔凯姆视为“关于世界”的发现ーー也就是说，社会力量是自然力量，其特点是外部性和约束性。这位讽刺家将迪尔凯姆视为一个对他和他的同时代人从17和18世纪继承的语言感到失望的人，他们设法拼凑出一套更适合19和20世纪用途的规范性词汇; 一旦社会学家发现迪尔凯姆的词汇可以做什么，很少有人有兴趣做笛卡尔的前辈所做的事情。这位形而上学家仍在寻求实现康德之前的启蒙梦想，即“让世界变得正确”，即用自然界的语言来描述社会。相比之下，讽刺主义者拥护法国革命者、黑格尔、浪漫主义诗人、尼采、海德格尔、德里达、杜威、詹姆斯、戴维森、罗蒂等人所持有的观点，即语言完全是人类的创造，任何事物都可以通过被重新描述而改变，改变我们说话的方式就是改变我们自己。

Having dismissed the metaphysical insistence that we discover Nature’s Own Language, the ironist alone seems fully prepared to explore the apothegm that socialization goes “all the way down.’’ So one might assume that sociologists would be predisposed to be ironists; but in fact, many sociologists object to an ironist posture on the ground that it is incompatible with the practice of social science.[96](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#bookmark108) Durkheim himself showed that you can get good results by thinking of social facts comme des choses, by treating societies as concrete, complex wholes, and by careful observations, comparisons, and statistical generalizations; and this Durkheimian vocabulary has thus led later social scientists to attempt to draw some epistemological moral from its success — speci®cally, to suggest that Durkheim’s achievements exemplihed or resulted from something called “the scientihc method,’’ whose exercise will lead us to the discovery of the reality of human societies. The significance of ironist writers like Kuhn, Dewey, and Rorty, however, lies in their argument that there simply is no epistemological moral to be drawn from Durkheim’s success, and that there is no “method” which will help us to get our propositions to “line up’’ with the social world - indeed, that the very notion of discovering Nature’s Own Language is itself wrongheaded. If Kuhn is right, most of the practice of modern science — including social science - is simply obeying the conventions of the discipline, being open to refutation by experience, not interfering with free discussion, not letting one’s hopes and fears influence conclusions unless those hopes and fears are shared by all those in the same line of work. In this sense, Rorty summarizes, the scientific method is simply “a suitable balance between respect for the opinions of one’s fellows and respect for the stubbornness of sensation” (1983d: 194—5). The metaphysical insistence that irony is incompatible with the practice of the “scientific method,’’ therefore, is reduced to the claim that irony is incompatible with a standard that does not, in fact, exist.

在摒弃了形而上学的坚持认为我们发现了自然的语言之后，只有反讽者似乎已经完全准备好去探索社会化“一路走下去”的箴言因此，有人可能会认为社会学家有成为反讽者的倾向; 但事实上，许多社会学家反对一种反讽姿态，理由是它与社会科学的实践不相容。涂尔干本人证明，通过将社会事实视为事物，通过将社会视为具体的、复杂的整体，通过仔细的观察、比较和统计概括，你可以得到好的结果; 这种涂尔干的词汇因此导致后来的社会科学家试图从它的成功中汲取一些认识论上的道德ーー特别是，提出涂尔干的成就是所谓的“科学方法”的例证或结果，这种方法的实践将引导我们发现人类社会的现实。然而，像库恩、杜威和罗蒂这样的讽刺作家的重要性在于他们的论点: 涂尔干的成功根本没有任何认识论上的道德可以借鉴，也没有任何“方法”可以帮助我们使我们的命题与社会世界“对齐”——事实上，发现自然语言的概念本身就是错误的。如果库恩是正确的，那么现代科学的大部分实践，包括社会科学，只不过是遵循学科的惯例，接受经验的反驳，不干涉自由讨论，不让一个人的希望和恐惧影响结论，除非这些希望和恐惧是所有从事同一行业的人共享的。在这个意义上，罗蒂总结道，科学方法只是“尊重同伴的意见和尊重感情的顽固之间的适当平衡”(1983d: 194-5)。因此，形而上学坚持反讽与“科学方法”的实践是不相容的，这种坚持归结为反讽与实际上并不存在的标准是不相容的。

How, one might ask, is this relevant to the history of social theory? Recall my earlier suggestion that the confusion between the notion that the world is out there and the quite different notion that the truth is out there tends to be exacerbated when the focus is on individual sentences rather than whole vocabularies. Such confusion, I observed, is less frequent when we turn from individual, criterion-governed sentences within language games to language games as wholes (i.e., games which we do not choose between by reference to criteria at all). Where intellectual history turns its attention from individual sentences to the larger vocabularies in which sentences are formulated — e.g., in works like Kuhn’s The Copernican Revolution or Skinner’s Foundations of Modern Political Thought — the notion that “the world’’ somehow decides how it wants to be described becomes less tenable and persuasive. The reader begins to see Copernicus and Galileo, Hobbes and Descartes, Durkheim and Weber, not as people who “got the world right,’’ but as writers casting about for a re-description, a metaphor, or a vocabulary that might tempt the rising generation to embrace it, and then see it embodied in their institutions.

有人可能会问，这与社会理论的历史有何关联？回想一下我早些时候的建议，即世界在那里的概念和真理在那里的完全不同的概念之间的混淆往往会加剧，因为关注的焦点是单个句子而不是整个词汇。我观察到，当我们从语言游戏中个别的、受标准管理的句子转向整个语言游戏(也就是说，我们根本不参照标准来选择游戏)时，这种混淆就不那么频繁了。思想史把注意力从单个句子转移到更大的词汇量上，在这些词汇量上，句子是用来表达的，例如，在库恩的《哥白尼革命》或斯金纳的《现代政治思想的基础》中，“世界”以某种方式决定了它想要被描述的方式，这种观念就变得不那么站得住脚，也不那么有说服力了。读者开始看到哥白尼和伽利略，霍布斯和笛卡尔，涂尔干和韦伯，不是作为“得到正确的世界”的人，而是作家寻找一个重新描述，一个隐喻，或一个词汇，可能诱使新生代接受它，然后看到它体现在他们的机构。

Not every kind of history, of course, is equally conducive to irony. In my introduction, I defended a role for “rational reconstructions’’ of Durkheim’s ideas which, for all their occasional anachronisms, at least serve to expand the circle of edifying conversational partners. In the absence of the appropriate measure of self-consciousness, however, such reconstructions often serve metaphysical rather than ironist purposes. In so far as the “ideally reasonable and educable Durkheim” is mistaken for the Real Durkheim, for example, and a particular description of his texts is confused with what Durkheim Really Meant, these “exercises in commensuration” serve only to increase the dogmatic, assertive, and self-righteous tone of modern sociological debate. How is one to know? As indicated above, the distinction between self-conscious anachronism and its metaphysical counterpart ultimately lies in the ironist’s recognition that the goal of debate is not consensus, but rather the continuation and enrichment of the conversation itself.

当然，并不是每一种历史都同样有利于讽刺。在我的序言中，我为迪尔凯姆的思想的“理性重建”的角色辩护，尽管它们偶尔有些时代错误，但至少有助于扩大对谈话对象的教育范围。然而，在缺乏适当的私我意识衡量标准的情况下，这种重建往往服务于形而上学的目的，而不是反讽的目的。例如，就“理想的、合理的、可教育的涂尔干”被误认为是真正的涂尔干而言，并且对他的文本的特定描述与涂尔干的真正意图相混淆，这些“相称的练习”只会增加现代社会学辩论的教条主义、自信和自以为是的基调。谁知道呢？如上所述，自我意识的时代错误与其形而上学对应物之间的区别最终在于反讽者认识到辩论的目标不是共识，而是对话本身的延续和丰富。

But more genuinely “historical” reconstructions — i.e., imagined conversations between Durkheim and his contemporaries, in their own language rather than ours — have at least the potential to encourage an ironist perspective. Like Plato in the early Socratic dialogues, Durkheim was pointing to a state of conceptual incoherence in the moral vocabulary of his culture, one that he sought to replace with what he sometimes called “the new rationalism” — i.e., a vocabulary more suitable to his own interests and purposes. Unlike the rationalism of Descartes, with its emphasis on idees claires et simples, Durkheim’s vocabulary emphasized that social phenomena were real things, concrete and complex, to be studied comme des choses. For the ironist, however, to speak of social facts in this way is simply to describe, and then re-describe, according to one's pragmatic interests and purposes. Similarly, to say that society is “essentially” anything at all is itself a survival of the metaphysical error of thinking that Nature prefers to be spoken of in one way rather than another. Since the ironist rejects the notion that true sentences are true because they in some sense “correspond” to reality, the seemingly endless debate between rationalism and empiricism — i.e., over what kind of reality a given sentence corresponds to — is over (Rorty 1982b: xvi). For the ironist, there is not even a standard by which we can say that Durkheim’s “new” rationalism (or “rationalist empiricism”) was better than its Cartesian antecedent. We can only say that it has come to seem better to subsequent generations of sociologists (Rorty 1982b: xxxvii). In any case, to them and to us, Durkheim is interesting because he recognized the limitations of a 17th-century vocabulary when confronted with the kinds of things that 20th-century people want to do.

但是更真实的“历史”重建ーー例如，迪尔凯姆和他同时代的人用他们自己的语言而不是我们的语言进行想象的对话ーー至少有可能鼓励一种反讽的观点。与柏拉图在早期苏格拉底对话中一样，迪尔凯姆指出了他的文化中道德词汇的概念不连贯状态，他试图用他有时称之为“新理性主义”的词汇来代替这种状态，即一种更适合他自己的兴趣和目的的词汇。与笛卡尔的理性主义不同，迪尔凯姆的词汇强调社会现象是真实的事物，具体而复杂，需要研究。然而，对于反讽者来说，以这种方式谈论社会事实，只是根据一个人的实用主义兴趣和目的来描述，然后再重新描述。同样，说社会是“本质上”的任何事物，本身就是一种形而上学的错误思维的生存，自然喜欢以这种方式而不是另一种方式来谈论它。由于反讽者拒绝接受真实句子是真实的这一观点，因为它们在某种意义上“符合”现实，理性主义和经验主义之间看似无休止的辩论ーー也就是说，一个给定的句子符合什么样的现实ーー已经结束了(Rorty 1982b: xvi)。对于反讽者来说，我们甚至没有一个标准可以说涂尔干的“新”理性主义(或“理性主义经验主义”)比笛卡尔的前身更好。我们只能说，对于后来的几代社会学家来说，这似乎变得更好了(罗蒂1982b: xxxvii)。无论如何，无论对他们还是对我们来说，涂尔干都是有趣的，因为当他面对20世纪人们想要做的事情时，他意识到了17世纪词汇的局限性。

It will be noted that Durkheim himself — utterly humorless and (his writings on education notwithstanding) obsessed with the discovery of Nature’s Own Language — seems to have been incapable of such irony. In this, he resembles many of the classic writers, whose views of scientihc knowledge were more similar to those of the 17th and 18th centuries than to our own. But this, together with the observation that their vocabularies are no longer ours, is doubly instructive — and also deeply ironic. For what we learn from the nominalist, historicist, and pragmatist way of re-describing past sociological thought is that what were once regarded as undeniable truths — scientihc propositions that were “true” because they corresponded to some putative social “reality” — were in fact the merest contingencies of a particular history, biography, language, and/or social structure. And, ironically, to learn this is surely to learn a more general truth, not just about the past, but about ourselves.

值得注意的是，涂尔干本人ーー完全没有幽默感，而且(尽管他在教育方面的著作如此)痴迷于发现自然界的语言ーー似乎不具备这样的讽刺能力。在这一点上，他与许多经典作家相似，他们的科学知识观与17、18世纪的科学知识观更为相似，而不是与我们现在的科学知识观相似。但这一点，加上他们的词汇已不再属于我们这一观察结果，具有双重的启发意义ーー同时也具有深刻的讽刺意味。因为我们从重新描述过去社会学思想的唯名论者、历史主义者和实用主义者那里学到的是，那些曾经被认为是不可否认的真理ーー那些因为符合某种假定的社会“现实”而“真实”的科学命题ーー实际上只是特定历史、传记、语言和/或社会结构的偶然事件。具有讽刺意味的是，了解这一点无疑是了解一个更普遍的真理，不仅仅是关于过去，而是关于我们自己。

Alsace and Lorraine contained great iron ore deposits, important textile works, rich forests, excellent soil, and a population of 1,600,000. Moreover, while the Alsatians spoke German, most of them were self-consciously French, having shared in its culture and history since the 17th century. The loss of Alsace and Lorraine was thus a particularly devastating condition of the peace, and one to which the French never reconciled themselves.

Alsace 和洛林拥有丰富的铁矿资源，重要的纺织工厂，茂密的森林，优良的土壤，160万人口。此外，尽管阿尔萨斯人说德语，但他们中的大多数自觉地说法语，自17世纪以来，他们一直分享着阿尔萨斯的文化和历史。因此，失去 Alsace 和洛林是一个特别具有破坏性的和平条件，法国人从来没有妥协过。

In his review of Antonio Labriola’s Essais sur la conception materialiste de I'histoire (1897), Durkheim acknowledged that “Either the collective consciousness floats in a vacuum, a sort of unrepresentable absolute, or it is related to the rest of the world through the intermediary of a substratum on which it consequently depends . . . [And] of what can this substratum be composed if not of the members of society as they are socially combined?’’ But Durkheim immediately added that there was no reason to associate this principle with the socialist movement, “of which it is totally independent. As for ourselves, we arrived at this proposition before we became acquainted with Marx, to whose influence we have in no way been subjected’’ (1978c: 127).

在评论安东尼奥•拉布里奥拉(Antonio Labriola)的《唯物史观论》(Essais sur la 卷)(1897年)时，涂尔干承认，“集体意识要么漂浮在一个真空中，一种无法表达的绝对意识，要么通过一个其所依赖的底层的中介与世界其他地方相关... ... 如果这个底层不是由社会成员组成的，而是由社会结合而成的，那么这个底层可以由什么组成呢?”但涂尔干立即补充说，没有理由把这一原则与社会主义运动联系起来，“社会主义运动是完全独立的。至于我们自己，我们在认识马克思之前就已经达到了这个命题，我们从来没有受到过马克思的影响”(1978c: 127)。

McManners estimates that in more than 300 colleges and in 80 or more “Little Seminaries,’’ there were 70,000 pupils, by contrast with 116,000 in the lay establishments of secondary education. In primary schools of the orders, approximately 1,500,000 of the country’s 4,000,000 children received their education. Even the State schools, with exclusively lay personnel, were much under the influence of the Church. Their day began with prayers, there were crucifixes on the walls, the bishop sat in the Conseil Academique of the Department, and there were representatives of the episcopate on the Conseil Superieur de l’Instruction Publique (1972: 21 — 2).

麦克曼纳斯估计，在300多所大学和80多所“小神学院”中，有7万名学生，相比之下，中等教育的非专业机构有11.6万名学生。在这些学校中，全国400万儿童中大约有150万接受了教育。即使是公立学校，只有非神职人员，也在很大程度上受到教会的影响。他们的一天从祈祷开始，墙上有十字架，主教坐在教会学术委员会，主教的代表在公共教学高级委员会(1972:21-2)。

Even the youthful Durkheim did not escape. Davy tells us that, while a student at the College d’Epinal in the early 1870s, he experienced a brief crisis of mysticism under the influence of an old Catholic schoolmistress — something he rapidly surmounted (Lukes 1972: 41)-

即使是年轻的涂尔干也没能逃脱。戴维告诉我们，19世纪70年代早期，当他还是爱普纳学院(College d’Epinal)的学生时，在一位年迈的天主教女教师的影响下，他经历了一次短暂的神秘主义危机——他很快就克服了这种影响(卢克斯1972:41)

Of 167 holders of episcopal office between 1870 and 1883, McManners observes, only 21 were of noble birth, 56 were from bourgeois or rich peasant families, and 90 were of “the people.'' Only 18 had spent signi®cant time in the parochial ministry before their elevation, 23 had risen through diocesan administration, and more than 90 had been teachers in seminaries or holders of academic chairs (1972: 25).

麦克曼纳斯指出，在1870年至1883年间担任主教职务的167人中，只有21人出身贵族，56人来自资产阶级或富裕的农民家庭，90人属于“人民”只有18人在升职之前在教区服务过很长时间，23人通过教区管理升职，超过90人在神学院任教或担任教务长(1972:25)。

In 1861, McManners observes, there were 134 parishes and 661 priests; in 1877, 159 “parishes’’ (including new chapels) and 723 priests; and in 1906, 185 “parishes’’ and 866 priests. In the XIIe and XXe arrondissements, parishes of 50,000 souls were common (1972: 7).

麦克曼纳斯观察到，1861年有134个教区和661名神父; 1877年有159个“教区”(包括新的小教堂)和723名神父; 1906年有185个“教区”和866名神父。在十二区和二十区，有50,000人的教区很常见(1972:7)。

Ferry told Jean Jaures that he wished “to establish humanity without a God and without a King,'' but added to his wife that he was “the elected representative of a people that makes wayside altars, that is fond of the Republic but is just as fond of its processions'' (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 84).

费里告诉让 · 乔雷斯，他希望“建立一个没有上帝和国王的人类”，但对他的妻子补充说，他是“一个人民的选举代表，建立路边的祭坛，喜欢共和国，但只是喜欢它的游行”(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:84)。

McManners 1972: 59. Divorce by mutual consent, however, was not reintroduced. An interesting defense of such self-restraint on the part of republican administrators can be found in Durkheim’s “Le Divorce par consentement mutuel” (1906).

麦克曼纳斯1972:59。然而，经双方同意的离婚并没有重新引入。迪尔凯姆的《平等同意离婚》(1906)对共和国行政人员的这种自我约束进行了有趣的辩护。

The significance of this reform should not be exaggerated. Ancient languages still occupied a third of the timetable in secondary classes, and reforms of 1884 and 1890 would reduce the relative importance of science, modern languages, and history. Students pursuing this largely literary baccalaureat es lettres could also take “preparatory’’ courses for the baccalaureat es sciences after their second or third form; but the distinction between the two baccalaureats was not eliminated until 1890 (Mayeur and Reberioux 1984: 88, 110).

这项改革的意义不应被夸大。古代语言仍占中学课程表的三分之一，1884年和1890年的改革将降低科学、现代语言和历史的相对重要性。追求这种主要是文学学士学位的学生也可以在他们的二年级或三年级之后参加科学学士学位的“预备”课程; 但是这两个学士学位之间的区别直到1890年才被消除(Mayeur and Reberioux 1984:88,110)。

Durkheim 1977: 18 — 19; 1982: 156—8. Though not a professional historian, Durkheim had been a pupil of Fustel de Coulanges, and thus knew how to read primary sources. Indeed, he read Alcuin in the original, and the great medievalist Christian Pfister found no complaint with the chapters on the Carolingian renaissance: “His documentation,” Halbwachs reports, “was as substantial as possible: the majority of his lectures included bibliographies which bore witness to massive reading” (1977: xiii).

涂尔干1977:18ー19; 1982:156ー8。虽然不是专业的历史学家，但迪尔凯姆是努马-丹尼斯·甫斯特尔·德·库朗日的学生，因此知道如何阅读原始资料。事实上，他读过阿尔昆的原著，伟大的中世纪学家克里斯蒂安 · 菲斯特对卡洛林文艺复兴上的章节没有抱怨: “他的文献,”哈尔布瓦克斯报告说，“是尽可能实质性的，他的大部分讲座包括见证了大量阅读的参考书目”(1977: xiii)。

Durkheim 1977: 32—4. Here again, and more specifically, Durkheim may have been indebted to Fustel. His account of the Frankish invasions, for example, appears at least implicitly as “anti-Germanist” as Fustel’s. Cf Fustel’s Histoire des institutions politiques de I'ancienne France (1875 — 89).

涂尔干1977:32ー4。这里再次，更具体地说，迪尔凯姆可能欠了 Fustel 一笔债。例如，他对法兰克人入侵的描述，至少隐含地表现出与福斯特尔一样的“反日耳曼主义”。法国古代政治制度史(1875-1889)。

In De la division du travail social, for example, Durkheim frequently refers to “Christian societies’’ rather than “the Middle Ages.’’ But the latter phrase appears quite frequently in L'Evolution pedagogique en France.

例如，在《社会劳动分工》一书中，迪尔凯姆经常提到“基督教社会”，而不是“中世纪”但后者在法国进化教育学中出现得相当频繁。

Durkheim 1977: 143. Lukes 1972: 77—8, has pointed to another “strikingly Burkean'' passage in Durkheim's 1887 essay on “La Science positive de la morale en Allemagne,'' even comparing it with a passage in the Reflections. While Lukes ascribes such conservative views to Durkheim's “early period,'' as the passage from L'Evolution pedagogique testifies, this was a standard argument that Durkheim produced regularly throughout his life. See, for example, Les Formes elementaires (1915: 87).

涂尔干1977:143。卢克斯1972:77ー8指出了涂尔干1887年论文《德国道德的积极科学》中另一段“惊人的伯克式”，甚至将其与《反思》中的一段进行了比较。卢克斯将这种保守的观点归因于涂尔干的“早期阶段”，正如《进化论》教育学中的一段话所证明的那样，这是涂尔干一生中经常提出的标准论点。例如，参见 Les Formes elementaires (1915:87)。

Durkheim 1977: 146. According to Lukes 1972: 106, Durkheim, the philosopher Octave Hamelin, and the specialist on Aristotle, Georges Rodier, offered “special tuition’’ on selected texts, in the effort to combat what they perceived as the “anti-scientific doctrines’’ then attracting many would-be schoolteachers.

Durkheim 1977: 154. This replacement of dialectic by experimental reasoning is quite natural, Durkheim added, for the latter is itself a kind of dialectic: “Just as dialectic consists in a systematic confrontation of opinions, so experimental reasoning consists in a systematic confrontation of facts.’’

涂尔干1977:154。涂尔干补充说，这种用实验推理取代辩证法的做法是很自然的，因为后者本身就是一种辩证法: “正如辩证法存在于对观点的系统对抗之中，实验推理也存在于对事实的系统对抗之中。”

Educational “realism,’’ of course, emerged well before the mid-19th century; but Durkheim insisted that the Renaissance ideal also endured long after Comenius, so that the “new kind of academic system’’ he sought to establish still struggled against it in the late 19th century.

当然，教育“现实主义”早在19世纪中叶就出现了; 但是迪尔凯姆坚持认为，文艺复兴时期的理想在夸美纽斯之后也存在了很长时间，因此他所寻求建立的“新型学术体系”在19世纪晚期仍然与之斗争。

In La Reforme intellectuelle et morale (1872), Ernest Renan observed that the victory of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War “was the victory of science. After Jena, the university of Berlin was the center of the regeneration of Germany. If we wish to rise from our disasters, let us imitate the conduct of Prussia’’ (1872: 55).

Durkheim's use of the term “realist'' to describe the educational theories of Comenius was directly derived from these secondary schools, or Realschulen. Durkheim specifically rejected the term “scientific'' on the ground that a Cartesian theory of education might equally be considered scientific. Instead, he argued, “it is better to define the educational theory which was born with Comenius by using the word which served to designate the ®rst schools in which it became institutionalized in Germany, and to call it Realist educational theory. This designation clearly marks the contrast which exists between it and that of the Humanists; they each gravitate towards quite different poles: one towards man in the abstract, the other towards the real world, towards things'' (1977: 288—9, 291)-

迪尔凯姆用“现实主义者”一词来描述夸美纽斯的教育理论，直接来源于这些中学，或者叫里尔舒伦。迪尔凯姆特别反对“科学”一词，理由是笛卡尔的教育理论可能同样被认为是科学的。相反，他认为，“最好用夸美纽斯这个词来定义与生俱来的教育理论，夸美纽斯在德国成为制度化的第一个学校，并称之为现实主义教育理论。这个名称清楚地标志着它与人文主义者之间的对比; 他们每个人都倾向于完全不同的两极: 一个是对抽象的人，另一个是对现实世界，对事物”(1977:288ー9,291)-

Here Durkheim took issue with Alfred Fouillee (1838 — 1912) who, together with Jean-Marie Guyau (1854—88), led the defense for a more traditional, humanist approach to French secondary education in opposition to the realism of Durkheim. Objecting in particular to Fouillee’s assertion that “classical studies have always had the honour to be suspect under despotisms,’’ Durkheim insisted that, while he “would not dream of claiming that cultivation of the humanities implies and necessarily imposes a particular political attitude,’’ the “association of the Humanist spirit with the spirit of traditionalism does indeed seem to be incontestable’’ (1977: 309).

在这一点上，迪尔凯姆与阿尔弗雷德 · 福利(1838-1912)意见相左。福利与让·马利·居约(1854-1988)一起，为法国中等教育提出了一种更为传统、人文主义的方法，与迪尔凯姆的现实主义相对立。迪尔凯姆特别反对傅利的断言，即“古典研究总是有幸在专制制度下受到怀疑,”他坚持认为，虽然他“不会梦想声称人文学科的培养意味着并且必然会强加一种特定的政治态度,”“人文主义精神与传统主义精神的联系确实似乎是无可争议的”(1977:309)。

The plausibility of the humanist conception of a permanent, essential human nature was itself the product of particular historical conditions — i.e., the Renaissance synthesis of Christian, Roman, and Greek ideals. “This explains why there is something abstract and relatively universal about [the ideal man of the Renaissance],” Durkheim observed, “for he is the product of a kind of spontaneous generalisation. Yet for all its generality, this ideal is still idiosyncratic and transitory, expressing the very special circumstances in which European civilisation developed” (1977: 324).

人文主义关于永恒的、本质的人性概念的合理性本身就是特定历史条件的产物ーー也就是说，文艺复兴时期对基督教、罗马和希腊理想的综合。涂尔干说: “这就解释了为什么文艺复兴时期的理想人物具有某种抽象性和相对普遍性，因为他是一种自发性概括的产物。然而，尽管这种理想具有普遍性，但它仍然是特殊的和短暂的，表达了欧洲文明发展的非常特殊的环境”(1977:324)。

An additional resource may have been Durkheim’s growing interest in the new “psychology of the unconscious.’’ Quite aside from Wundt — to be discussed in chapter 4 (see pp. 209—30) — Pierre Janet had been a classmate of Durkheim’s at the Ecole Normale, and Theodule Ribot had collaborated with Durkheim on the Revue philosophique. “Within us,’’ Durkheim observed, there live “other men than those with whom we are familiar,’’ which reveal “the existence of an unconscious psychic life beyond that of consciousness: a life which science alone is gradually managing to uncover, thanks to its special methods of investigation’’ (1977: 330).

一个额外的资源可能是涂尔干对新的“无意识心理学”日益增长的兴趣除了《 Wundt 》ーー将在第四章中讨论(见第209-30页)ーー皮埃尔 · 珍妮特是涂尔干在诺曼底师范学院的同学，忒阿杜勒 · 里伯特与涂尔干在《歌剧哲学》上有过合作。迪尔凯姆观察到，“在我们内心深处，除了我们熟悉的人，还有其他人存在”，这揭示了“意识之外无意识的精神生活的存在: 由于其特殊的研究方法，科学正在逐渐揭示这种生活”(1977:330)。

The original lecture-course of 1902—3 comprised twenty lectures. The first, on the relations between pedagogy and sociology, was published in the Revue de metaphysique et de morale in 1903, and was reprinted in Education et sociologie in 1922. The second, on the methods of pedagogy, is not extant. The remaining eighteen lectures were published in 1925 as L'Education morale. Steven Lukes reports a conversation with the late Georges Davy, during which Davy indicated that the text of L'Education morale is a combination of the texts of various courses of different dates. Lukes adds his belief that Henri Durkheim possessed lecture-notes taken at an early delivery of the course, but that he was unable to make use of these. Lukes’ discussion, like my own, is thus based on the published texts just mentioned (1972: 110 n. 7; and Fauconnet 1961: v—vi).

1902-1903年最初的讲座课程包括20个讲座。第一篇是关于教育学与社会学的关系，1903年发表在《形而上学与道德》杂志上，1922年再版在《教育与社会学》上。第二，关于教育学的方法，并不存在。其余的18个讲座于1925年作为 L‘ Education 士气出版。史蒂文 · 卢克斯报道了与已故的乔治 · 戴维的一次谈话，戴维在谈话中指出，《教育士气》的文本是不同日期的各种课程文本的组合。卢克斯补充说，他相信亨利迪尔凯姆拥有早期讲课笔记，但他无法使用这些。卢克斯的讨论，就像我自己的一样，是基于刚刚提到的已发表的文本(1972:110 n.7; 和 Fauconnet 1961: v ー vi)。

最近，菲利普 · 贝斯纳尔(Philippe Besnard)将这些关于道德教育的讲座的日期追溯到1898年ーー也就是《自杀》(1897)出版后不久ーー并补充说，它们有着相同的概念方案(1993:127; 米勒1996:111)。

The reference to France and Germany is implicit here: “as a result of whatever it is beyond or outside of particular societies that inclines them to the same ideal,’’ Durkheim observed, “it by no means follows that their differing individualities must vanish, losing themselves in one another. For this suprasocietal ideal is too rich in its variegated elements to be expressed and realized in its totality through the character of any one such state. There must be a kind of division of labor between the two, which is and will continue to be their reason for existence’’ (1961: 78).

提到法国和德国在这里是不言而喻的: “作为超越或超越特定社会的结果，使他们倾向于相同的理想,”涂尔干说，“这决不意味着他们不同的个性必须消失，在彼此中迷失自己。因为这个超社会的理想太丰富了，它的各种元素太丰富了，不能通过任何一个这样的状态的特征来表达和实现它的全部。这两者之间必须有一种分工，这种分工现在是并将继续是它们存在的理由”(1961:78)。

This notion again sheds light on Durkheim’s notion of the social origins of the categories of human reason, indicating the extent to which his theory of knowledge was subservient to his theory of morality. See Durkheim and Mauss 1963; Durkheim 1915: 21—33.

Like Freud, therefore, Durkheim viewed children through the same lens that he viewed primitive peoples. The habits of the child, for example, were analogous to the customs of savages. Durkheim’s discussion of the child’s “natural suggestibility’’ was based upon his reading of the early psychological studies of Jean-Marie Guyau, Alfred Binet, and Victor Henry. Durkheim 1961: 131 — 2, 136—7, 139—42.

因此，像弗洛伊德一样，涂尔干也是通过同样的视角来看待儿童，就像他看待原始人一样。例如，这个孩子的习惯就类似于野蛮人的习俗。迪尔凯姆对儿童的“自然暗示性”的讨论是基于他对让·马利·居约、阿尔弗雷德 · 比奈和维克多 · 亨利的早期心理学研究的阅读。涂尔干1961:131ー2,136ー7,139ー42。

Durkheim (1961: 165) attributes this objection to the expiatory theory toJean-Marie Guyau.

涂尔干(1961:165)将这种异议归因于让-玛丽 · 圭亚那的赎罪理论。

It is this condition of advanced societies, of course, which requires sociology itself: “Made to regulate social relationships in societies as complex as ours, morality itself is very complex. Behavior condemned by morality is repudiated because of its diverse repercussions that reach throughout the whole extent of the social structure — repercussion that cannot be seen with the naked eye but that science alone discovers step by step, thanks to its special methods and funded knowledge’’ (1961: 173).

当然，正是先进社会的这种状况需要社会学本身: “在像我们这样复杂的社会中，道德本身是非常复杂的，它被用来调节社会关系。被道德谴责的行为之所以遭到否定，是因为它在社会结构的整个范围内产生了各种各样的影响——这种影响是肉眼无法看到的，但是由于其特殊的方法和资助的知识，科学自己一步一步地发现了这种影响。”(1961:173)。

As already indicated, the distinction between the first two “elements’’ of moral education (the spirit of discipline and the attachment to social groups) mirrors the discussion, in Le Suicide, between “regulation” and “integration.’’

Laromiguiere's Les Principes de ^intelligence (1815—18), a lecture-course at the Sorbonne, established a compromise between Condillac's sensationalism and the spiritualist views of Rousseau's Savoyard Vicar (Stock-Morton 1988: 29).

Royer-Collard, a philosopher, statesman, and noted parliamentary orator, was professor of the history of philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1811. After the Restoration, with Francois Guizot (1787 — 1874), he became a leader of the doctrinaires. His influence declined after the Revolution of 1830, but he remained important in educational reform.

By its very definition, Durkheim observed, a “number'' is susceptible of being indefinitely augmented or diminished; but “the infinite'' is fixed, and the notion of an “infinite number'' is thus meaningless (1884: 98).

根据它的定义，涂尔干观察到，一个“数字”容易被无限地增加或减少; 但是“无限”是固定的，因此“无限数字”的概念是没有意义的(1884:98)。

In support of this view, Durkheim cited George Henry Lewes’ observation, in The Physical Basis of Mind (1877), that “[t]he scientific conception of inert, insensible matter ... is reached only through a long education which consolidates a mind capable of abstraction; very certainly, animals and savages never attain this [kind of mind]’’ (p. 308). Durkheim had apparently encountered this important passage in Alfred Espinas’ Des societes animates (1978: 413).

为了支持这一观点，迪尔凯姆在《心灵的物理基础》(1877)一书中引用了乔治·亨利·刘易斯的观察，即“只有通过长期的教育，才能巩固一个能够抽象的心灵，才能达到惰性、无知的物质的科学概念，当然，动物和野蛮人永远达不到这种(心灵)”(第308页)。涂尔干显然在阿尔弗雷德 · 埃斯皮纳斯的《社会动画》(1978:413)中遇到了这个重要的段落。

Durkheim was careful here to distinguish this specifically Kantian notion of mind from the theory of innate ideas — i.e., “There are no ideas completely formed, engraved in our minds prior to experience. Before experience, there is nothing there'' — as well as the notion of an impersonal reason, first advanced by Plato, and more recently by Cousin and Bouillier (1884: 126).

涂尔干在这里非常仔细地区分了这种康德式的精神概念和先天观念理论ーー即，“在经验之前，我们的头脑中没有完全形成、铭刻的观念。在经验之前，那里没有任何东西”ーー还有非个人理性的概念，最早由柏拉图提出，最近由表哥和布利耶提出(1884:126)。

Durkheim recognized that Mansel had refuted Mill on precisely this point. “We can imagine,’’ Mansel says, “the same stone sinking in water ninety-nine times, and floating on the hundredth, although experience shows us only the ®rst phenomenon. Experience always shows us a man’s head on his shoulders, and the horse’s head on the horse’s body. But there’s no impossibility in our imagining a centaur’’ (1884: 149).

涂尔干认识到，曼塞尔恰恰在这一点上反驳了穆勒。“我们可以想象,”曼塞尔说，“同一块石头在水中下沉九十九次，漂浮一百次，尽管经验告诉我们只有第一个现象。经验总是告诉我们一个人的头在他的肩膀上，马的头在马的身体上。但是我们想象一个半人马并不是不可能的”(1884:149)。

Durkheim 1884: 258. As we shall see, one of the more distinctive elements of Durkheim's treatment of ethics was his reversal of this Kantian argument — using the idea of freedom to establish the moral law.

The fourth argument for the spirituality of the soul — often conjoined with the first three — is that the soul and the body are frequently in conflict, and that this indicates the existence of two distinct principles (1884: 497—8).

This historical survey is important, not just for understanding Boutroux, but also for understanding Durkheim. Boutroux “revealed to [Durkheim] the great philosophers of the past,'' Davy reports, “and, in his penetrating and objective fashion of reconstructing and rethinking systems, revived and presented scienti®cally before his pupils the history of philosophy'' (Lukes 1972: 58).

这种历史调查是重要的，不仅为了理解布特鲁克斯，而且为了理解涂尔干。布特鲁克斯“向迪尔凯姆揭示了过去伟大的哲学家,”戴维报告说，“并且，以他重建和反思系统的敏锐和客观的方式，在他的学生面前科学地复兴和展示了哲学史”(卢克斯1972:58)。

This elimination of the human faculty for purposeful action, Boutroux observed, is parallel to the dismissal, by experimental psychology, of the human soul (1914: 194).

This contrast between ancient and modern freedom, Momigliano (1982: 333) adds, had already been formulated in Benjamin Constant’s De I’esprit de Conquete (1814); but in Fustel it led, not to a defense of modern liberalism, but to the religious ideas of ancient peoples (1956: 12).

莫米利亚诺(1982:333)补充说，古代和现代自由之间的这种对比，已经在班杰明·康斯坦《征服的精神》(1814)中阐述过，但在 Fustel，它并没有导致对现代自由主义的捍卫，而是导致了古代人民的宗教思想(1956:12)。

Durkheim 1997: 7e. Until recently, most Durkheim scholars have had to depend on the English translation by Ralph Manheim in Montesquieu and Rousseau: Forerunners of Sociology (1960). But this itself is a translation, not from the original Latin, but from the French translation published by Armand Cuvillier in 1953. The Cuvillier translation itself replaces Durkheim’s Latin translations of passages from Montesquieu with the original passages themselves, suppressing differences between them, adding several misprints and mistakes in the main text, and reprinting Durkheim’s notes — which are full of mistakes — without correction. Manheim’s English edition of Cuvillier reproduces the errors of the latter, adding some of its own, and dropping most of Durkheim’s notes. For these reasons and others, I have used the most recent, 1997 translation of the original Latin text by W. W. Miller and Emma Grif®ths.

涂尔干1997:7e。直到最近，大多数迪尔凯姆的学者不得不依赖于拉尔夫 · 曼海姆在《孟德斯鸠》和《卢梭: 社会学的先驱》(1960)中的英译本。但是这本书本身就是一个译本，不是从拉丁文原文翻译过来的，而是从阿曼德 · 库维利耶1953年出版的法文译本翻译过来的。库维利耶译本本身用原文段落取代了迪尔凯姆对孟德斯鸠段落的拉丁译本，压制了原文段落之间的差异，在原文中增加了几处印刷错误和错误，并在没有更正的情况下重印了迪尔凯姆的笔记，这些笔记中错误百出。美瀚的英文版《居维利耶》重现了后者的错误，增加了一些自己的错误，并删除了涂尔干的大部分笔记。由于这些原因和其他原因，我使用了最新的，1997年的原始拉丁文本的 W.W.米勒和艾玛格里夫斯翻译。

Durkheim, 1997c: 7e, 9e. Miller (1997b: 3) notes that the Latin thesis never mentions a scientia socialis, almost always referring instead to scientia politica and its study of res politicae, while admitting that the Latin thesis itself — not to mention De la division du travail social — is clearly concerned with social science, social facts, and social things. The earlier translations of Alengry (1937) and Cuvillier (1953) adopted the latter usages, while Miller’s more literal and conventional translation retains the terms political science and political things. All agree, however, that Durkheim’s intended reference was to the “social’’ — e.g., including religion and morality — rather than the merely “political,’’ and though I prefer the Miller/Griffiths translation and will follow it below, I will also speak of “social’’ science and “social’’ things.

涂尔干，1997年 c: 7e，9e。米勒(1997b: 3)指出，拉丁文论文从未提到过“社会科学”，几乎总是提到“政治科学”及其对“政治事务”的研究，同时承认，拉丁文论文本身ーー更不用说“社会工作的分工”ーー显然与社会科学、社会事实和社会事物有关。阿伦格里格(1937年)和库维利耶(1953年)的早期译本采用了后者的用法，而米勒更为直译和传统的翻译保留了政治科学和政治事物的术语。然而，所有人都同意，迪尔凯姆有意提到的是“社会”ーー例如，包括宗教和道德ーー而不仅仅是“政治”，尽管我更喜欢米勒/格里菲斯的翻译，并将在下文跟进，但我也会谈到“社会”科学和“社会”事物。

Montesquieu, of course, had been a powerful influence on German jurisprudence (see 1949: 19—28, and chapter 4, pp. 195—202).

当然，孟德斯鸠对德国法理学产生了强大的影响(见1949年第19-28页和第4章第195-202页)。

[75](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote75)

In general, Durkheim considered Comte a poor interpreter of Montesquieu's work and its significance. In the Cours, he observed, Comte's evaluation of Montesquieu's thought is “a very brief judgment, that is in part mistaken, as already seen, and that above all does not seem based on attentive, careful reflection on the theory'' (1997: 71e).

总的来说，迪尔凯姆认为孔德对孟德斯鸠的作品及其意义的诠释很差。在《法院》中，他评论道，孔德对孟德斯鸠思想的评价是“一个非常简短的判断，部分是错误的，就像我们已经看到的那样，而且最重要的是，这个判断似乎并不是基于对这个理论的认真、仔细的反思”(1997:71e)。

Durkheim 1997: 46e±47e. Durkheim’s examples here are largely taken from book VIII: “Of the Corruption of the Principles of the Three Governments’’ (Montesquieu 1949: 120—5).

涂尔干1997年: 46e ± 47e。涂尔干在这里的例子主要摘自第八卷: “三国政府原则的腐败”(孟德斯鸠1949:120ー5)。

[77](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote77)

See particularly chapter 16, “How some Legislators have confounded the Principles which govern Mankind,’’ and chapter 19, “How this Union of Religion, Laws, Manners, and Customs amongst the Chinese was effected’’ (1949: 300—1, 303—4).

特别参见第十六章“一些立法者是如何混淆了人类的统治原则”和第十九章“中国人之间的宗教、法律、礼仪和习俗的联合是如何产生的”(1949:300ー1,303ー4)。

Here Tarde seems to be referring to the argument of De la division du travail social, book 1, chapter vii, section 2 — i.e., that “everything in the contract is not contractual.''

这里，塔德似乎指的是《社会劳动分工》第一卷第七章第二节的论点ーー也就是说，“合同中的一切都不是契约性的。”

A series of articles published in the Revue philosophique. There are small but occasional differences between the 1894 articles and the more famous 1895 volume, as there are also differences between the deplorable 1938 translation of Les Regies and the more conscientious 1982 translation. The differences between the texts of 1894 and 1895 have been clarihed in Jean-Michel Berthelot's 1988 edition of Les Regies. Tarde's immediate response was to the 1894 articles rather than to the 1895 volume, but the variations are inconsequential to my argument, so I've quoted from the more widely accessible 1982 translation.

在《讽刺哲学》杂志上发表的一系列文章。在1894年的文章和更著名的1895年的作品之间有一些细微但偶尔的差别，在1938年悲惨的《雷吉斯》译本和1982年更严谨的译本之间也有一些差别。让-米歇尔 · 贝特洛(Jean-Michel Berthelot)1988年版的《雷吉斯》(Les Regies)阐明了1894年和1895年文本之间的差异。塔德的第一反应是对1894年的文章，而不是对1895年的卷，但变化是无关紧要的我的论点，所以我引用了更广泛的1982年的翻译。

Probably because the course on Le Contrat social was given in Bordeaux, Henri Peyre (1960: xv) concluded that the lectures must have been prepared before 1901. Some of the passages of Le Contrat social cited by Durkheim (e.g., 1960c: 82) make it clear that he was using the 1896 edition edited by Edmond Dreyfus-Brisac.

可能是因为《社会契约论》的课程是在波尔多开设的，亨利 · 佩尔(1960: xv)得出结论，这些讲座一定是在1901年之前准备好的。迪尔凯姆引用的《社会契约论》中的一些段落(例如，1960c: 82)清楚地表明，他使用的是由埃德蒙德 · 德雷福斯-布里萨克编辑的1896年版本。

[83](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote83)

Durkheim 1960c: 68. Durkheim’s reference here was to the Discours sur l’origine de l’inegalite'.

涂尔干1960c: 68。涂尔干在这里指的是《关于“不平等的起源”的论述》。

“All these philosophers, in short, constantly talking of need, greed, oppression, desires, and pride have imported into the state of nature ideas they had taken from society. They talk of savage man and they depict civilized man’’ (Rousseau 1994: 24).

“简而言之，所有这些哲学家，不断地谈论需要、贪婪、压迫、欲望和骄傲，已经把他们从社会中获得的思想输入到自然状态中。他们谈论野蛮人，他们描绘文明人”(卢梭1994:24)。

Durkheim 1960c: 72—3. This scholarly quibble reveals how well Durkheim knew Rousseau’s entire oeuvre, as well as its secondary interpretations.

涂尔干1960c: 72ー3这种学术上的狡辩揭示了涂尔干对卢梭全部作品及其次要解释的了解程度。

[85](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote85)

Durkheim 1960c: 78—9. Durkheim’s account roughly corresponds to Rousseau 1994: 55—69; 1966: 31—46.

涂尔干1960c: 78ー9. 涂尔干的叙述大致相当于卢梭1994:55ー69; 1966:31ー46。

[86](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote86)

Here Durkheim was referring to Rousseau’s Discours sur I'Economie politique (1758).

这里涂尔干指的是卢梭的《论经济政治》(1758)。

[87](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote87)

Durkheim 1960c: 83—4. Durkheim notes that Rousseau was unaware that there are natural organisms whose parts have this same individuality. The reference here is to “a fragment from Distinction fondamentale’ (pp. 308, 310). I’ve been unable to identify any work written by Rousseau that possesses this title.

涂尔干1960c: 83ー4。涂尔干指出，卢梭没有意识到有些自然有机体的各个部分具有相同的个性。这里的参考文献是“来自《基础知识》的一个片段”(第308页，310页)。我找不到任何卢梭的作品有这个标题。

[88](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote88)

Hugo Grotius (Huig de Groot) (1583—1645), Dutch jurist, philosopher and man of letters. Rousseau’s treatment of Grotius is found in book 1, chapter 4 of The Social Contract (1968: 53—8).

雨果 · 格罗秀斯(惠格 · 德 · 格鲁特)(1583-1645) ，荷兰法学家、哲学家和文学家。卢梭对待 Grotius 的方式见于《社会契约论》(1968:53ー8)第一卷第四章。

[89](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote89)

Durkheim 1960c: 109—10. Here the English translation of Durkheim's text refers to Le Contrat social, book 11, chapter 2. This is clearly a mistake. The argument is actually developed in book 11, chapter 12 (1968: 98—100). See also book 1, chapter 5 (1968: 58).

涂尔干1960c: 109ー10。这里涂尔干文本的英译是指《社会契约》 ，第11卷，第2章。这显然是个错误。这个论点实际上是在第11卷第12章(1968:98ー100)中提出的。另见第一卷第五章(1968:58)。

Durkheim 1979: 162. Unfortunately, the text of the lecture-notes on Emile is not nearly so complete and polished as that on Le Contrat social. It is rather an outline of each of the four lectures, combined with passages taken from Emile itself.

涂尔干1979:162。不幸的是，关于埃米尔的课堂讲稿的文本远没有《社会契约论》那么完整和优美。这是四个讲座的大纲，加上从埃米尔本身摘录的段落。

[91](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote91)

Rousseau 1911: 9. For convenience I have used the 1911 translation by Barbara Foxley, which is the same used in the 1979 edition of Durkheim’s lectures on Emile.

卢梭1911:9。为了方便起见，我使用了芭芭拉•福克斯利(Barbara Foxley)1911年的译本，与1979年版迪尔凯姆(Durkheim)关于埃米尔(Emile)的讲座中使用的译本相同。

[92](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote92)

Durkheim 1979: 185. Durkheim emphasized elsewhere in his notes: “Social man in the image of natural man" (1979: 182).

涂尔干1979:185。涂尔干在他的笔记中强调: “自然人形象中的社会人”(1979:182)。

[93](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote93)

Bloom 1979a: 5. Here, of course, Rousseau follows the critique of Christianity in Machiavelli’s Discourses (1517).

布鲁姆1979a: 5。这里，当然，卢梭遵循了马基雅维利的论述(1517)中对基督教的批判。

[94](file:///F:/book/Englishbook/html/The%20Development%20of%20Durkheims%20Social%20R...%20%28z-lib.org%29.htm#footnote94)

In the third and final book of De la Division du travail social, Durkheim discussed the “anomic division of labor’’ as one of its three “pathological forms.’’ But in that earlier work, “anomie’’ refers, not to an imbalance between needs and means, but to a more general “lack of mutual adjustment among the parts of the social organism,’’ a notion Durkheim attributed specifically to Comte and to Espinas.

涂尔干在《社会劳动分工论》的第三部也是最后一部中，讨论了作为其三种“病态形式”之一的“失范的劳动分工”但是在早期的作品中，“失范”指的不是需求和手段之间的不平衡，而是更普遍的“社会有机体各部分之间缺乏相互调节”，这个概念迪尔凯姆特别归因于孔德和 Espinas。
