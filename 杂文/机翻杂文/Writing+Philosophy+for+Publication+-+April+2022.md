## Writing Philosophy for Publication 出版写作哲学

I was asked to write this for a 2021 seminar at the ANU run by Al Hajek and Brian Hedden. It's just one guy's opinion—or rather, a bunch of opinions collected by one guy—but hey, maybe you'll find it useful.

我被邀请为阿尔 · 哈杰克和布莱恩 · 海登在澳大利亚国立大学举办的2021年研讨会撰写这篇文章。这只是一个人的观点ーー或者更确切地说，是一个人收集的一堆观点ーー但是，嘿，也许你会发现它很有用。

So you want to publish some philosophy—preferably, good philosophy in a nice journal. How do you do it?

所以你想要发表一些哲学ーー最好是在一本不错的杂志上发表一些好的哲学。你是怎么做到的？

This document has some tips for each stage of the process, from choosing ideas to appeasing Referee #2. But it’s not a full guide. I am not telling you how to do philosophy, or how much you should publish. I'm just offering advice on how to pick and polish ideas so that, if you want publications, you can maximize your odds while minimizing stress.

本文档对于过程的每个阶段都有一些提示，从选择想法到安抚裁判 # 2。但它不是一个完整的指南。我不是在告诉你如何学习哲学，或者你应该发表多少文章。我只是提供一些如何挑选和润色想法的建议，这样，如果你想要出版物，你就可以在最大限度地减少压力的同时，最大限度地提高成功的几率。

## Part 1: Publishability 第一部分: 可出版性

Before we get to the process, let/s talk about the telos. Some papers have “PUBLISH ME!” written all over them. Others, however brilliant, do not. What makes the difference? If you want to publish, what should you be aiming for, and what should you avoid?

在我们进入这个过程之前，让我们谈谈 telos。有些报纸有“出版我!”都写在上面了。其他人，无论多么聪明，都没有。有什么区别吗？如果你想出版，你应该瞄准什么，你应该避免什么？

You should aim for:

你的目标应该是:

- ## (1) A paper whose contribution is immediately obvious. (1)贡献显而易见的论文

I don't just mean you immediately tell the reader how important your thesis is. (“In section 2, I prove that everyone else is dumb and wrong.”) Nor do I mean showing the reader all of your cards in the first section. That's what the rest of the paper is for! A good intro is a mix. You want to tell the reader what you're up to in a way that gives them a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come—like a movie trailer, but with spoilers.

我的意思不仅仅是你要立即告诉读者你的论文有多重要。(“在第二部分中，我证明了其他人都是愚蠢和错误的。”)我的意思也不是在第一部分向读者展示你所有的卡片。这就是报纸剩下的部分！一个好的介绍是一个混合。你想告诉读者你正在做什么，让他们一瞥即将发生的事情ーー就像一部电影预告片，但要有剧透。

A snappy descriptive title helps. But to my mind, the really crucial thing is to start your introduction by framing the question. Don't just launch into your thesis, bury us in citations, or bust out your “road map.” First lay down the basic concepts that your reader needs to understand the question at issue, then give them a sense of why it matters, and only then give a peek at your answer, making sure that your point ends up looking new and interesting.

一个简洁的描述性标题很有帮助。但在我看来，真正重要的事情是从提出问题开始你的介绍。不要只是开始你的论文，埋葬我们在引用，或爆出你的“路线图。”首先列出你的读者需要理解的问题的基本概念，然后让他们知道为什么这个问题很重要，然后再看一眼你的答案，确保你的观点最终看起来新颖有趣。

An easy way to do this is by explaining the main issue in a way that creates tension, then telling the reader (not laboriously showing!) how you're going to resolve that tension in a novel way. I think I do a decent job of this in[my paper with Jack Spencer.](https://philpapers.org/go.pl?aid=MUOKOOv1&amp;id=MUOKOO) Our question is: are objective ‘oughts' authoritative? Our intro explains objectivity and authority, and we state our answer (no!), but we don't nutshell the argument. We just give a glimpse: we'll be using a case (the miners puzzle) and a certain principle (called “monotonicity”). That's enough to build tension. Then we cite around to assure the reader no one's said this before.

一个简单的方法就是用一种能够制造紧张气氛的方式来解释主要问题，然后告诉读者(而不是费力地展示!)你要如何用一种新颖的方式来解决这种紧张关系。我觉得我和杰克 · 斯宾塞的论文写得不错。我们的问题是: 客观的“应该”是权威的吗？我们的介绍解释了客观性和权威性，我们陈述了我们的答案(不!)但是我们不能简化论点。我们只是让大家看一下: 我们将使用一个案例(矿工难题)和一个特定的原则(称为“单调性”)。这足以制造紧张气氛了。然后我们引用一些例子来向读者保证，以前没有人这样说过。

Here are two classics with less publishable framings:["Singling out Properties”](http://www.mit.edu/~yablo/sop.pdf)(one of my alltime favorites, but the style is risky to emulate),[“Reference and Definite Descriptions”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183143?seq=1)(no early glimpse of the main idea—and for no good reason).

以下是两部不太适合出版的经典作品: 《单独挑选属性》(Singling out Properties)(我一直以来最喜欢的作品之一，但这种风格模仿起来有风险) ，《参考文献和明确描述》(Reference and Defent Descriptions)(没有提前看到主要思想ーー而且没有充分的理由)。

- ## (2) A goldilocks thesis. (金发姑娘论文

By which I mean: not too epic, not too tiny—just right. You want a claim that's grand enough to be interesting but not so grand that you lack room for a proper defense.

我的意思是: 不太宏伟，不太小ー刚刚好。你想要一个足够引人注目的诉讼请求但又不至于太过引人注目以至于缺乏合适的辩护空间。

If you/re struggling to publish an ambitious project, the problem might not be quality but quantity: your thesis may be overspilling your paper. (You can't frame the question right if the question doesn't fit the frame!) If so, consider some ways of cutting down on grandiosity. Can you split the paper in two? Can you weaken the thesis?

如果你正在努力发表一个雄心勃勃的项目，问题可能不是质量而是数量: 你的论文可能会溢出你的论文。(如果问题不符合框架，你就不能把问题框架正确!)如果是这样的话，考虑一些减少浮夸的方法。你能把纸一分为二吗？你能弱化这个论点吗？

One nice way to weaken theses is by changing an argument for a specific view into a paradox for everyone. That way, you aren't on the hook for giving a comprehensive defense of your view. You can just give a partial defense, be honest about the view's shortcomings— and that's enough. The full defense can wait until later papers.

削弱这些论点的一个很好的方法就是把一个特定观点的论点变成一个对每个人都适用的悖论。这样的话，你就不用为自己的观点进行全面辩护了。你只需要给出一个部分的辩护，诚实地面对视图的缺点ーー这就足够了。完整的辩护可以等到以后的文件。

Example. I had a paper that I thought was good—it had a Revise & Resubmit at Ethics, and my advisors and friends liked it. But the R&R fell through, and the paper kept getting rejected—even desk rejected!—by journal after journal. What was wrong? Eventually I realized the conclusion was probably too grand. I had been arguing that my own wacky form of deontology was true; I then had to assure the reader that, even though the view invites tons of objections, I had tons of answers, which I'd tell them about in later papers. Cold comfort!

例子。我有一篇自认为不错的论文ーー《伦理学修订与再提交》 ，我的顾问和朋友们都很喜欢。但是休养生息失败了，论文不断遭到拒绝ーー甚至连办公桌也被拒绝! ーー被一本又一本的日记拒绝。怎么了？最终我意识到这个结论可能太宏大了。我一直在争论我自己古怪的道义论形式是正确的; 然后我不得不向读者保证，即使这种观点招致了大量的反对意见，我有大量的答案，我会在以后的论文中告诉他们。冷冰冰的安慰！

In the end, I changed the conclusion into a dilemma. I said that this wacky deontology is the only kind that's unified, so deontologists have a hard choice: be disunified, or be wacky.[The](https://philpapers.org/go.pl?aid=MUOFRTv1&amp;id=MUOFRT) [paper](https://philpapers.org/go.pl?aid=MUOFRTv1&amp;id=MUOFRT)was then accepted at the next journal without revisions.

最后，我把这个结论变成了一个进退两难的局面。我说过，这种古怪的道义论是唯一统一的，所以道义论者面临着一个艰难的选择: 要么不统一，要么古怪。这篇论文后来被下一期杂志接受，没有经过任何修改。

The flipside of this problem: if you are struggling to publish a paper that is very long, it might be that you are overestimating how much you have to say. A medium-sized paper that makes a medium-sized point is vastly more publishable than a long paper with a mediumsized point. Example: I have a paper in Philosophical Studies that is less important than the journal's average, but it got in because it was accordingly short (6,500 words). If I'd left it at 8,000 words, it would've been rejected. Same if I'd sent it to fancier journals like Mind. This brings me to:

这个问题的另一面是: 如果你正在努力发表一篇篇幅很长的论文，那么你可能高估了你要说的内容。一篇中等篇幅的论文比一篇中等篇幅的长篇论文更容易发表。例如: 我在《哲学研究》上有一篇论文，它的重要性不及杂志的平均水平，但是它之所以被收录，是因为它相应地很短(6500字)。如果我写到8000字，就会被拒绝了。如果我把它寄给像 Mind 这样的高端杂志也一样。这让我想到:

- ## (3) The right venue. (三)适当的场地

Even if your paper is exactly what it’s supposed to be, that doesn't mean that it will get in wherever. Ask your advisors and savvy friends what journals you should be sending which papers to. Journals differ in their preferred (a) topics, (b) word counts, and (c) level of grandeur. (Inquiry will publish singles; AJP wants doubles; Phil Review is after grand slams.) There isn/t much else to say about this, since it’s going to depend on what kind of papers you/re trying to publish, and I haven't read your papers. Though I suppose you could always email me.

即使你的论文是完全符合要求的，那也不意味着它会进入任何地方。问问你的顾问和精明的朋友，你应该把哪些论文发给哪些期刊。期刊在(a)主题、(b)字数和(c)宏伟程度上有所不同。(调查将出版单曲; AJP 想要双打; Phil Review 想要大满贯。)关于这一点，我没有什么可说的，因为这取决于你想发表什么样的论文，我还没有读过你的论文。不过你可以给我发邮件。

## Preparing the manuscript 准备手稿

These might go without saying, but...

这些可能不言而喻，但是..。

- -   Pick a nice font, decent margin sizes, and good spacing. For example: 12pt Times New Roman double-spaced with one-inch margins. (And check what the journal likes here; Phil Review wants double-spaced footnotes, for example.)

    - 选择一个漂亮的字体，适当的边距大小，和良好的间距。例如: 12pt Times New Roman 双倍行距，边距为1英寸。(比如，看看这本杂志喜欢什么; 《菲尔评论》想要双倍行距的脚注。) - -  Anonymize your paper carefully. You don't want to waste your time, as I have before, following up with managing editors about self-citations and what not.

    小心匿名你的论文。你不想像我以前那样浪费时间，跟进主管编辑关于自我引用和其他方面的问题。 - -   Cite carefully. Good citations can (a) signal that you know your stuff, (b) help your reader see what makes your paper new, and (c) help the editors find a referee—who will be pleased to see that you’ve acknowledged their work.

    仔细引用。好的引用可以(a)表明你了解你的文章，(b)帮助你的读者了解是什么使你的文章更新，(c)帮助编辑找到一个裁判ーー他会很高兴看到你对他们的工作表示认可。

So much for what to aim for. Now, things to avoid:

这就是我们的目标，现在，我们要避免的事情:

## ⑴ Clutter. 杂物

I don't just mean pruning a few words. In the final stages of writing, you should at least consider scrapping whole paragraphs or even pages. If your paper is stodgy, messy, or busy, a helpful exercise is to delete a section and just see what happens. If that ruins the paper— great! Hit undo and send it out. If the paper suddenly flows—even better! Just edit for consistency, and you have a sleeker paper, which means it's easier to read, which means your peer reviewers will be happy.

我不是说删减几个词。在写作的最后阶段，你至少应该考虑删除整个段落甚至整个页面。如果你的论文枯燥、凌乱或者繁忙，一个有用的练习就是删除一个部分，看看会发生什么。如果这会毁了报纸的话，太好了！按撤销键，然后发出去。如果纸张突然流动，那就更好了！为了保持一致性而编辑，你的论文就会更光滑，这意味着它更容易阅读，这意味着你的同行评审者会很高兴。

Of course, it hurts to delete something you've poured your heart into. But that's publishing: one heartbreak after another. You just can't be sentimental about these things. (If it helps, you can keep your deleted paragraphs in a graveyard document like I do to reassure yourself that nothing was really "deleted." Whatever works!)

当然，删除一些你倾注心血的东西是很痛苦的。但这就是出版: 一个接一个的心碎。你不能对这种事感情用事。(如果有帮助的话，你可以像我一样把你删除的段落保存在墓地文件中，这样可以让你自己确信没有什么是真正“删除”的只要管用就行!)

- ## (2) Dismissiveness. (2)不屑一顾

The best advice I ever got about publishing philosophy was from Agustin Rayo. He told me that, as a young philosopher, it’s natural to see the people you disagree with as the enemy, and to see your papers as an attack on them for the benefit of your audience (namely, all other philosophers, who are of course eagerly awaiting your every word). But this is totally backwards. The people you're "attacking" typically are your audience—the ones who actually care enough to read your work, think about it deeply, write replies—and they are your colleagues for life.

关于出版哲学，我得到的最好的建议来自奥古斯丁 · 雷奥。他告诉我，作为一个年轻的哲学家，很自然地会把与你意见相左的人视为敌人，而把你的论文看作是对他们的攻击，是为了你的读者的利益(也就是说，所有其他的哲学家，他们当然都在热切地等待你的每一句话)。但这完全是反过来的。你“攻击”的人通常是你的听众ーー那些真正关心你的工作、深思熟虑、写回复的人ーー他们是你一生的同事。

They are also, for what it’s worth, your likely referees. They are the peers who will be doing the reviewing.

不管怎样，他们也是你可能的裁判，他们是做评审的同行。

So why annoy them? It’s in your interest, and intrinsically good, to write with grace. Emphasize agreements. Acknowledge others’ contributions. Concede weaknesses in your position. Don/t be dismissive, and definitely don/t nitpick—especially not over mere words. It’s good to clarify that you use terms one way whereas they use them in another; maybe your way is better. But be gracious. Remember who your readers are.

那为什么要惹恼他们呢？优雅地写作符合你的利益，本质上也是好的。强调协议。感谢他人的贡献。承认自己的弱点。不要不屑一顾，更不要吹毛求疵ーー尤其不要仅仅因为几句话而吹毛求疵。有必要澄清一下，您以一种方式使用术语，而他们以另一种方式使用术语; 也许您的方式更好。但是要有礼貌。记住你的读者是谁。

I have never once regretted being generous in a paper, and I have never once been glad I took a cheap shot.

我从来没有后悔在报纸上慷慨解囊，也从来没有因为自己说了一句不中听的话而感到高兴。

- ## (3) Side Quests. (3)支线任务

In a role-playing game, there is a main quest (slay the dragon!), and there are side-quests (collect the relics!). The point of side-quests is to add depth to the game for people who want to get their money's worth exploring the world, having some fun, taking their time—in other words, the exact opposite mindset of a busy peer-reviewer, who just wants to finish your paper and learn what you have to say.

在角色扮演游戏中，有一个主要任务(杀死恶龙!)，有支线任务(收集文物!).支线任务的目的是为那些想要获得金钱的人增加游戏的深度，他们想要探索这个世界，找点乐子，花点时间——换句话说，一个忙碌的同行评论者的完全相反的心态，他们只是想完成你的论文，了解你要说什么。

Rule of thumb: no side-quests. Referees and editors want a straight shot to the dragon. Most of your paper should be preparing for, traveling to, and carrying out the main quest.

经验法则，不能做支线任务。裁判和编辑都希望直接看到龙。你的大多数论文应该是准备，旅行，并执行的主要任务。

This rule can also help you choose which ideas to focus on. I once had a paper that ended with "boring" side-quests: a series of replies to objections. Several people said I was taking too much time away from developing my own views. Eventually I took the hint. For about a year, I kept trimming the section, and I decided to focus on the objections that were most essential to clarifying the paper’s positive view, using them to further the main quest. When [the paper](https://philpapers.org/archive/MUOFRT.pdf)was finally accepted, the referee seemed to think the replies were the best part— what a turnaround!

这条规则还可以帮助您选择要关注的想法。我曾经有一篇论文，以“无聊的”支线任务结尾: 一系列对反对意见的回答。有几个人说我花了太多时间来发展自己的观点。最后我明白了。在大约一年的时间里，我一直在修改章节，我决定把重点放在那些对阐明论文的正面观点至关重要的反对意见上，利用它们来进一步推进主要的探索。当论文最终被接受时，裁判似乎认为答复是最好的部分ーー真是一个转机！

## Part 2: The Process 第二部分: 过程

The path to getting your paper accepted starts with brainstorming and ends, if you're lucky, with desperate pleas to an anonymous referee. Let me just give one tip per stage.

让你的论文被接受的途径开始于头脑风暴，如果你幸运的话，结束于对匿名裁判的绝望恳求。让我给每个阶段一个提示。

## Step 1: Choosing Ideas 第一步: 选择想法

The first step may be the most underrated. You can pour your heart and soul into a paper— not to mention months of your life—and still struggle to publish it, if you simply choose the wrong idea. I don/t mean choosing a bad idea. I mean choosing one that isn/t publishable.

第一步可能是最被低估的。你可以全身心地投入到一篇论文中ーー更不用说几个月的时间了ーー但如果你只是选择了错误的观点，你仍然很难发表它。我不是说选择一个坏主意。我的意思是选择一个不能出版的。

Partly, this is a matter of whether the thesis is the right size. But like I said, if it's too big, there are ways to fix this: split the paper, reframe the conclusion. If it's too small, you could try combining it with ideas you have left over from other papers, or discussing objections.

在一定程度上，这取决于论文的篇幅是否合适。但就像我说的，如果它太大，有办法解决这个问题: 拆分论文，重新构建结论。如果它太小，你可以尝试将它与你从其他论文中遗留下来的想法结合起来，或者讨论反对意见。

Here's my main tip. Don't worry too much about choosing the perfect-sized idea from the get-go. It's important to choose a topic that's publishable (best evidence: people you admire are publishing on it). But for the first draft, don't get hung up on framing. Just frame the paper in a way that makes it easy to write. If you find it easy to write the giant manifesto first, go ahead—you can chop it up later. I usually prefer to start small, but that's just me.

这是我的主要建议。不要太担心从一开始就选择完美尺寸的想法。选择一个可以发表的话题是很重要的(最好的证据: 你崇拜的人正在发表这个话题)。但是对于初稿，不要纠结于框架。只要把纸框起来，使它容易写就行了。如果你觉得先写这个巨大的宣言很容易，那就写吧ーー你可以以后再把它切碎。我通常喜欢从小事做起，但那只是我的想法。

If you are really struggling to get the paper down (or up) to size, that may be a sign that it's not publishable—at least, not for you right now. Don't beat yourself up. It's part of the process. You can't know which ideas are going to be publishable a priori. Thankfully, your guesses will get better over time.

如果你真的很难把报纸缩小(或者提高)规模，这可能是一个迹象，表明它不能发表ーー至少，现在不适合你。别自责了。这是过程的一部分。你不可能事先知道哪些想法会被发表。谢天谢地，随着时间的推移，你的猜测会越来越准确。

## Step 2: Writing the Damn Paper 第二步: 写论文

As I said, you want your paper's contribution to be immediately obvious, even to referees who disagree with your views and are skimming the paper. In light of that, let me give one tip, which I haven't seen anyone give yet. Your paper should be focused as much as possible on vivid, specific ideas, like good journalism. Don't heap on hyper-abstract language.

正如我所说的，你希望你的论文的贡献立即显而易见，即使是对那些不同意你的观点和浏览论文的裁判。有鉴于此，让我给一个建议，我还没有看到任何人给。你的论文应该尽可能集中在生动、具体的观点上，比如好的新闻报道。不要堆在超抽象的语言上。

Witness the awful abstractness of Grice's Studies in the Ways of Words, page 1:

见证格莱斯《言语方式研究》(Grice’s Studies in the Ways of Words)可怕的抽象性吧，第1页:

# Prolegomena 序言

There is a familiar and, to many; very natural maneuver which is of frequent occurrence in conceptual inquiries, whether of a philosophical or of a nonphilosophical character. It proceeds as follows: one begins with the observation that a certain range of expressions E, in each of which is embedded a subordinate expression a—let us call this range E(a)—is such that its members would not be used in application to certain specimen situations, that their use would be odd or inappropriate or even would make no sense; one then suggests that the relevant feature of such situations is that they fail to satisfy some condition C (which may be negative in character); and one concludes that it is a characteristic of the concept expressed by a, a feature of the meaning or use of a9 that E(a) is applicable only if C is satisfied. Such a conclusion may be associated with one or more of the following more specific claims: that the schema E(a) logically entails C, that it implies or presupposes C, or that C is an applicability/appropriate-ness-condition (in a specially explained sense) for a and that a is misused unless C obtains.

在概念探究中，有一种常见的、对许多人来说非常自然的策略，无论是哲学性质的还是非哲学性质的，这种策略经常出现。其结果如下: 首先观察到一定范围的表达式 E，其中每个表达式都嵌入了一个从属表达式 a ーー让我们称之为这个范围 E (a)ーー是这样的，它的成员不会被用于应用于某些样本情况，它们的使用将是奇怪的或不适当的，甚至将是没有意义的; 然后建议这些情况的相关特征是它们不能满足某些条件 C (可能性质是负的) ; 最后得出结论，这是概念的一个特征，表达的意义或使用的一个特征，即 E (a)只有在 C 满足的情况下才适用。这样的结论可能与下列一个或多个更具体的主张有关: 模式 E (a)在逻辑上必然包含 C，它暗示或预设 C，或者 C 是 a 的适用性/适当性条件(在特别解释的意义上) ，a 被滥用，除非 C 获得。

Before mentioning suspect examples of this type of maneuver, I would like to make two general remarks. First, if it is any part of onc\*s philosophical concern, as it is of mine, to give an accurate general account of the actual meaning of this or that expression in nontechnical discourse, then one simply cannot afford to abandon this kind of maneuver altogether. So there is an obvious need for a method (which may not, of course, be such as to constitute a clear-cut decision procedure) for distinguishing its legitimate from its illegitimate applications. Second, various persons, including myself, have pointed

在提到这种演习的可疑例子之前，我想作两个一般性的评论。首先，如果一个人的哲学关注的任何一部分，正如我的一样，对非技术性话语中这个或那个表达的实际意义给出一个准确的概括性说明，那么一个人就不能完全放弃这种策略。因此，显然需要一种方法(当然，这种方法可能不构成一种明确的决策程序)来区分其合法与非法应用。其次，包括我自己在内的很多人都指出

What is he talking about? (I laugh every time at that indispensable qualification: “(which may be negative in character).w Ah, now I get it!)

他在说什么？(每次看到这个不可或缺的限定条件，我都会笑: “(这个限定条件在性格上可能是消极的)。”。啊，现在我明白了!)

Now read the first paragraphs of Zach Barnett’s “Why You Should Vote to Change the Outcome.”

现在阅读扎克 · 巴奈特的《为什么你应该投票来改变结果》的第一段

When voting comes with a cost, why pay it? Sometimes, there is a simple answer. We pay the cost to make our preferred outcomes likelier. When I cast my vote for Class President or Team Captain, there's a certain result I want, and I’m trying to bring it about.

投票是要付出代价的，为什么还要付出代价呢？有时候，答案很简单。我们付出代价是为了让我们喜欢的结果更可能发生。当我投票选举班长或队长时，我希望得到一个确定的结果，而且我正在努力实现这个结果。

One might worry, though, that this simple rationale is inapplicable to very large elections. After all, when there are millions and millions of voters, the chance that my individual vote will make a difference to the final outcome is utterly miniscule. How could it be rational for me to do something that's virtually certain to have zero impact?

不过，有人可能会担心，这个简单的理由不适用于非常大规模的选举。毕竟，当有成千上万的选民时，我个人的投票对最终结果产生影响的可能性微乎其微。对我来说，做一件几乎肯定没有任何影响的事情怎么可能是理性的呢？

In response to this challenge, one might encourage me not to overlook the magnitude of the stakes. If there are millions of voters, there are, presumably, millions of people who will be affected by the result. Yes, the chance that my vote makes the difference is very tiny, but the difference my vote could make is very great. Arguably, the magnitude of the stakes can, at least sometimes, offset the tininess of the chance of affecting the outcome—making it rational to vote solely in virtue of the expected consequences of doing so. This is the consequentialist defense of voting.

为了应对这一挑战，有人可能会鼓励我不要忽视其中的利害关系。如果有数以百万计的选民，想必也会有数以百万计的人受到选举结果的影响。是的，我的投票产生影响的可能性非常小，但我的投票能产生的影响是非常大的。可以说，至少在有些时候，利害关系的重大程度可以抵消影响选举结果的微小可能性，从而使完全凭借这样做的预期后果来投票变得合理。这是结果主义者对投票的辩护。

And off he goes. He hasn/t gotten to his contribution yet, but already, we know exactly what the question is—why vote?—and we are getting a vivid look at the specific idea that Barnett will argue for in greater depth: the consequentialist defense.

他走了。他还没有说到他的贡献，但是，我们已经确切地知道问题是什么ーー为什么要投票? ーー我们正在生动地观察巴奈特将要深入讨论的具体观点: 结果主义的辩护。

Now, I don't mean to imply that abstraction is always bad. It's good when you really need to be precise about the scope of what you're saying. But publishable papers are more like Barnett's than Grice's, especially in their opening pages. Papers in high places tend to lead not with gratuitous formalism but with intuitive examples. Barnett gets to his examples in sentence four. In Grice's fourth sentence, we're told that if we want examples we'll just have to wait!

现在，我并不是说抽象总是不好的。当你真的需要精确地描述你所说的话的范围时，这很好。但可发表的论文更像是巴奈特的，而不是格赖斯的，尤其是在开篇。位高权重的论文往往不是以无理的形式主义为导向，而是以直观的例子为导向。巴奈特在第四句中举了一些例子。在格赖斯的第四个句子中，我们被告知，如果我们需要例子，我们只能等待！

## Step 3: Rejection 第三步: 拒绝

Expect it. You can write a great paper, send it to a plausible venue, and end up with what feels like nothing to show for it—a mean set of comments or an aloof desk rejection. Again: you can't get sentimental about this stuff. It gets easier. I promise.

等着瞧吧。你可以写一篇很棒的论文，把它发送到一个看似合理的地方，最后却得到一些看起来毫无价值的东西ーー一些刻薄的评论或者一张冷漠的桌子。再说一遍: 你不能对这些东西感情用事。会好起来的。我保证。

One common piece of advice is that you should ignore rejections. The journals are a “crap shoot." If you get snakes eyes, just reroll, and eventually, you'll win.

一个常见的建议是你应该忽略拒绝。那些日志就是“垃圾邮件”如果你看到蛇眼，就翻个白眼，最终你会赢的。

I'm not sure this is good advice. In my experience, journals often agree, and the system is less random than it looks. A single rejection can be a fluke. But if your paper gets rejected multiple times, then unless you're sure that your referees were anomalies, edit the paper. Especially if you got multiple complaints about the same thing. That's always a blessing: you know exactly what to work on.

我觉得这不是个好建议。根据我的经验，期刊通常会达成一致，而且这个系统并不像看上去那么随机。一次拒绝可能是侥幸。但是如果你的论文被多次拒绝，那么除非你确定你的推荐人是异常的，否则就编辑论文。特别是当你收到同一件事的多次投诉时。这总是件好事: 你知道该做什么。

Think of yourself as a movie producer doing test-screenings. You'd rather not have to do any big edits—and would hate to resort to reshoots—but you want everyone to like the final cut. Of course, you can't make everyone like it, and you can't just mangle the film. The hope is to find simple fixes that will win back big chunks of the audience.

把自己想象成一个试映的电影制片人。你宁愿不用做任何大的剪辑ーー也不愿意重拍ーー但你希望每个人都喜欢最后的剪辑。当然，你不能让每个人都喜欢它，你不能只是破坏电影。我们的希望是找到简单的解决方法，从而赢回大部分观众。

That's why I say it’s a blessing when two referees agree. It's like having multiple test audiences say they hate the love triangle. A good producer lives for that kind of feedback!

这就是为什么我说两个裁判意见一致是一种祝福。这就像有多个测试观众说他们讨厌三角恋。一个好的制片人就是为这种反馈而活的！

If I may give my own advice: when you/re in the process of (re)submitting your paper, identify the parts most likely to get it rejected—the scenes when most people leave the theatre. Your paper won't please everyone. But you want to know which things might confuse the reader, annoy your opponents, and risk further rejection.

如果我可以给出我自己的建议: 当你在(重新)提交论文的过程中，找出最有可能被拒绝的部分ーー大多数人离开剧院的场景。你的论文不会让每个人都满意。但是你想知道哪些东西可能会让读者感到困惑，惹恼你的对手，并冒着进一步被拒绝的风险。

## Step 3\*: Resubmission 步骤3 \* : 重新提交

Congratulations: you've gotten a Revise and Resubmit...now what?

恭喜你: 你已经得到了一个修订和重新提交... 现在怎么办？

Obviously, you have to resubmit a revised paper. Less obviously, you should add in a short cover letter, in which you go through the referees' points and explain the changes you did or didn't make. This report is almost as important as the revisions themselves.

显然，你必须重新提交修改过的论文。不那么明显的是，你应该添加一个简短的求职信，在其中你通过裁判的要点，并解释你做了或没有做的改变。这份报告几乎和修订本身一样重要。

How do you write it? Standard advice: be succinct and professional. You can start with a quick “thank you,” and by the end you want to have covered the referees' major points. No tangents, no flippant slang. (You'd be amazed at the stuff you see as a referee.) I find it helpful to start the letter before doing the actual revisions, but you could go the other way around. Just double-check that the letter is accurate before sending it off.

你怎么写的？标准建议: 简洁专业。你可以从一句简短的“谢谢”开始，然后在结束的时候你希望已经谈到了裁判的主要观点。没有偏题，没有轻率的俚语。(作为一个裁判，你会对自己看到的东西感到惊讶。)我发现在实际修改之前开始写信是很有帮助的，但是你可以反过来写。只要在寄出之前再确认一下信件是否准确就可以了。

Now the substance. How do you decide when to listen to the referees?

现在说重点，你怎么决定什么时候听裁判的？

It depends, of course, on whether you agree with their advice. If you do, life is simple: just make the paper as good as you can in the ways that they want. If you don't agree, life gets complicated. You can grit your teeth and do what they tell you, or you can plead your case in the cover letter. Neither option is ideal. Generally, I grit my teeth on the little things and stand my ground on the big stuff.

当然，这取决于你是否同意他们的建议。如果你这样做了，生活就简单了: 只要按照他们想要的方式尽可能地把报纸做好就行了。如果你不同意，生活就会变得复杂。你可以咬紧牙关照他们说的做，或者你可以在求职信中为自己辩护。这两种选择都不理想。一般来说，我对小事咬紧牙关，对大事坚持自己的立场。

But there's a helpful rule of thumb. Since life is easy when the refs are right, always see their suggestions in the best possible light. For example, if they say the introduction needs cuts, don't get defensive, and don't think “That sounds like work.” Sit down and look for good ways to make cuts. If you really can't find any, that's ok; just say so in the cover letter. But look carefully, because if you do find cuts, it's a double win. You've got a better paper and a better cover letter.

但有一个有用的经验法则。因为当裁判是正确的时候，生活是容易的，所以总是从最好的角度来看待他们的建议。例如，如果他们说介绍需要削减，不要防御，不要认为“这听起来像工作。”坐下来想想怎么削减开支。如果你真的找不到，没关系，只要在求职信中说出来就行了。但是仔细看看，因为如果你找到削减，这是一个双赢。你有更好的论文和更好的求职信。

## Repeat? 再说一遍？

I've also got a tip about quantity. If you want to publish more papers at the highest quality you manage, don’t just put out singles: put out albums.

我还得到了一个关于数量的建议。如果你想以你管理的最高质量发表更多的论文，不要只发表单曲: 发表专辑。

It takes time, effort, and even cash to read up in a new area. If you can use what you learn to write multiple papers, why not at least try? If the band is warmed up, why leave after the first song?

它需要时间，努力，甚至现金来阅读一个新的领域。如果你可以用你学到的东西写多篇论文，为什么不至少尝试一下呢？如果乐队已经准备好了，为什么在第一首歌之后就离开？

Of course, there are also reasons to branch out into new topics—inspiration, for example. Being narrow can be a false economy. But I’m not saying “be narrow.” I’m just saying: you won’t publish lots of great work if each project starts from scratch. If you've never written two papers on the same topic, try it. Or try splitting your biggest papers in two. Every paper needs something new—but not everything new!

当然，我们也有理由探讨新的话题，比如灵感。狭隘可能是一种虚假的经济。但我不是说“要狭隘”我只是说: 如果每个项目都从头开始，你就不会发布很多伟大的作品。如果你从来没有写过两篇关于同一主题的论文，那就试试吧。或者试试把你最大的报纸一分为二。每份报纸都需要一些新的东西，但不是所有的东西都需要新的！

## Conclusion 结论

That/s it from me. Feel free to email me suggestions for this document, since I plan to keep it updated. Most of the advice in here is the sort of thing one has to repeat to oneself. (“You just can’t be sentimental” about journal rejections—if only it were that easy!) The advice is also supposed to be universalizable, not just a way to get ahead of others. I7d rather focus on things that make the process more pleasant for everyone.

我说完了。随时给我电子邮件建议这个文件，因为我计划保持更新。这里的大多数建议是那种人们必须重复给自己听的东西。(对于日记被拒，“你不能感情用事”ーー要是真有那么容易就好了!)这个建议也应该是普遍适用的，而不仅仅是一种领先别人的方法。I7d 更愿意把注意力集中在那些能让过程对每个人来说都更愉快的事情上。

On that note, one last thought.

说到这里，最后一个问题。

I know I said publishing is suffering, and that you should expect rejection. It is, and you should. But that doesn’t mean that you have to dread publishing, or that you can’t have any fun. If you are struggling to motivate yourself to publish, I recommend trying to find things about the process that are intrinsically interesting or rewarding to you. Try on new framings. Instead of trying to please the refs, you’re aiming to make your paper’s ideas accessible to everyone. Instead of racking up publication points, think of yourself as getting to the bottom of a fascinating puzzle.

我知道我说过出版业很痛苦你应该预料到会被拒绝。是的，你应该这么做。但这并不意味着你必须害怕出版，或者你不能有任何乐趣。如果你正在努力激励自己去发表文章，我建议你试着去发现这个过程中对你本质上有趣或有益的东西。试试新的框架。而不是试图取悦裁判，你的目标是让你的论文的想法对每个人都可以理解。与其在出版物上累积积分，不如把自己想象成一个令人着迷的谜题的答案。

Because that is what you’re doing. Publishing is an imperfect part of a beautiful cooperative system by which we produce and circulate ideas. To succeed in the system, sometimes you have to think strategically (and read dreary guides like this one). But you don’t want to overdo the cynical strategizing. You have to keep in touch with the reasons why you like your papers, and the reasons why it can be such a joy to share your ideas with the philosophical world.

因为这就是你在做的。出版业是一个美好的合作体系的不完善部分，我们通过这个体系产生和传播思想。为了在这个系统中取得成功，有时你必须从战略的角度思考(阅读像这样枯燥的指南)。但是你不想过分玩世不恭的策略。你必须保持联系，为什么你喜欢你的论文的原因，以及为什么它可以这样一个乐趣，分享你的想法与哲学世界。
